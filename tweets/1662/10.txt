1662-10-20 17:18 To the Duke’s house: but whether it was in over-expecting or what, I know not, but I was never less pleased with a play in my life.

1662-10-20 11:26 I saw the so much desired by me picture of my Lady Castlemaine, which is a most blessed picture; and that that I must have a copy of.

1662-10-20 09:02 Killigrew did so commend “The Villaine,” a new play made by Tom Porter; as if there never had been any such play come upon the stage.

1662-10-19 20:16 I am sorry to hear that the news of the selling of Dunkirk is taken so generally ill, as I find it is among the merchants.

1662-10-19 16:31 I with Mr Townsend walked in the garden, advising with him about Tom’s business. He says I offer fair to give her 30l. joynture and no more.

1662-10-19 15:07 Mr. Moore recovers well; his doctor coming to him, one Dr. Merrit, we had some of his discourse of anatomy, and other things, very pleasant.

1662-10-19 07:20 I put on my first new laceband; and so neat it is, that I am resolved my great expense shall be lacebands.

1662-10-18 16:13 I intent upon my workmen, especially my joyners, who will make my dining room very pretty.

1662-10-18 09:48 Having resolved of my brother’s entertaining his mistress’s mother to-morrow I sent my wife thither to lie there to-night and to direct him.

1662-10-17 11:04 Mrs Haslerigge, the great beauty, is got with child, and now brought to bed, and lays it to the King or the Duke of York.

1662-10-17 10:44 With Mr. Creed to Westminster Hall, and thither comes Captn. Ferrers. We to Creed’s chamber, and there sat a good while and drank chocolate.

1662-10-17 09:50 To my Lord Sandwich, and told him how well things do go in the country, of which he was very glad, and seems to concern himself much for me.

1662-10-17 08:33 Tom comes to me, and I advise him how to deal with his mistress’s mother about his giving her a joynture.

1662-10-16 20:30 The King gives them half-pay, more than is used in such cases. They never used to have any thing, and yet the men were most discontented.

1662-10-16 20:28 To the Treasury office, where Sir John and I did stay late paying money to the men that are saved out of the Satisfaction that was lost.

1662-10-16 06:36 I rose in good temper, finding a good chimneypiece made in my upper dining-room chamber, and the diningroom wainscoat in a good forwardness.

1662-10-15 22:17 Having left our horses at their masters, walked home, found all things well, and with full joy, though very weary.

1662-10-15 18:08 Finding our horses in good case and the night being pretty light, we even made shift to reach London, though both of us very weary.

1662-10-15 08:42 Dr. Fairbrother told us how the room we were in was the room where Cromwell and his associated officers did begin to plot their mischiefs.

1662-10-15 07:56 I went forth and showed Mr. Cooke King’s College Chapel, Trinity College, and St. John’s College Library.

1662-10-14 21:12 And so by moonlight most bravely all the way to Cambridge, with great pleasure, whither we come, and took up at the Bear.

1662-10-14 17:58 I took leave of father, mother, Pall, to whom I have shown no kindness since I come, for I find her so ill-natured that I cannot love her.

1662-10-14 17:49 I did with most compleat joy of mind go from the Court with my father home, and in a quarter of an hour did get on horseback.

1662-10-14 16:09 The steward, as he promised me, did find pretensions kindly and readily to put off their admittance, by which I find they are much defeated.

1662-10-14 10:55 The jury being sworn and the charge given them, they fell to our business, finding the heir-at-law to be my uncle Thomas.

1662-10-14 09:07 I did digest into a method all I could say in our defence, in case there should be occasion, and so to the court at the Lordshipp.

1662-10-13 21:59 Waiting with much impatience and doubt the issue of to-morrow’s Court, I to bed.

1662-10-13 17:08 To see with what mirth they come all home together in pomp with their milk, and sometimes they have musique go before them.

1662-10-13 17:07 With my father took a melancholy walk to Portholme, seeing the country-maids milking their cows there, they being there now at grass.

1662-10-13 08:24 To Huntingdon to the Crown, and there did sit and talk, and eat a breakfast of cold roast beef, and so Sheply to St. Ives Market.

1662-10-13 07:19 To Hinchingbroke, and with Mr. Sheply did look over the house, and I do, I confess, like well of the alteracions, and do like the staircase.

1662-10-12 19:28 Their drink do not please me, till I did send to Goody Stanks for some of her’s which is small and fresh, with a little taste of wormewood.

1662-10-12 11:03 To church, where I saw most of the gentry of the parish; among others, Mrs. Hanbury, a proper lady, and Mr. Bernard and his Lady.

1662-10-12 08:19 Made myself fine with Captain Ferrers’s lace band, being lothe to wear my own new scallop, it is so fine.

1662-10-11 20:17 I rode to Hinchingbroke (Will with me), and there to my Lady’s chamber, but, it being night, and my head full of business, staid not long.

1662-10-11 13:09 To dinner, where there being nothing but a poor breast of mutton, and that ill-dressed, I was much displeased, there being Mr. Cooke there.

1662-10-11 11:58 I walked up and down the house and garden, and find my father’s alteracions very handsome.

1662-10-11 11:22 I rode to Huntingdon, and so to Brampton; where I found my father and two brothers, and Mr. Cooke, my mother and sister.

1662-10-11 06:44 Up betimes, and a little breakfast, a poor one, like our supper, such as I cannot feed on, because of my she-cozen Claxton’s gouty hands.

1662-10-10 17:08 Roger Pepys has gone out of town to keep a Court; I was forced to go to Impington to take such advice as my uncle and his son could give me.

1662-10-10 15:00 This day there is a Congregation for the choice of officers in the University. Dr. Fairbrother after dinner carries me to the Schooles.

1662-10-10 14:21 In Cambridge I to my cozen Angier’s house; and there found Dr. Fairbrother, with a barrel of good oysters, a couple of lobsters, and wine.

1662-10-10 08:38 My feet so swelled with pain that I could not get on my boots, which vexed me to the blood. I was forced to pay 4s. for a pair of old shoes.

1662-10-09 21:55 I to bed, very well, but my feet being much cramped by my new hard boots that I bought the other day of Wotton were in much pain.

1662-10-09 21:08 A gentleman tells me, that it is believed the Queen is with child, for that the coaches are ordered to ride very easily through the streets.

1662-10-09 20:19 We got to Ware before night; and resolved to ride to Puckeridge, which we did, though the way was bad, by help of company riding before us.

1662-10-09 13:28 I got on horseback at our back gate, with my man Will with me, both well-mounted on two grey horses.

1662-10-09 12:33 I should have dined at Sir W. Pen’s at a venison pasty with the rest of our fellows, but I could not get time, but sent for a bit home.

1662-10-08 20:56 I do find myself much bound to go handsome, which I shall do in linen, and so the other things may be all the plainer.

1662-10-08 20:49 I brought my scallop home, a very neat one. It cost me about 3l, and 3l. more I have given Captain Ferrers to buy me another.

1662-10-08 19:28 To my Lord’s, but he is at White Hall with the King, before whom the puppet plays I saw this summer in Covent-garden are acted this night.

1662-10-08 09:42 It is the greatest comfort and encouragement that ever I had in my life, and do owe it all to Mr. Coventry’s goodness and ingenuity.

1662-10-08 09:40 The Duke of York did yesterday of his own accord tell my Lord that he did thank him for one person brought into the Navy, naming myself.

1662-10-07 13:49 At the office all the morning, dined at home with my wife.

1662-10-06 20:22 I hear that Mr. Moore is gone very sick to the Wardrobe this afternoon, which troubles me much both for his own sake and for mine.

1662-10-06 09:01 Upon enquiry into the miscarriages of the Duke’s family, Mr. Biggs, his steward, is found very faulty, and is turned out of his employment.

1662-10-05 14:29 To talk with my wife, chiefly about her learning to dance against her going next year into the country, which I am willing she shall do.

1662-10-05 10:08 This day the parson has got one to read with a surplice on. I suppose himself will take it up hereafter, for a cunning fellow he is.

1662-10-05 07:04 We fell out about my maid Sarah, whom my wife would fain put away, when I think her as good a servant as ever came into a house.

1662-10-04 20:21 Examining the particulars of the miscarriage of the Satisfaction, sunk on the Dutch coast through the negligence of the pilott.

1662-10-03 22:15 Doing business till bedtime, it being my manner to spend too much of my daytime with my wife and the workmen and do business at night.

1662-10-03 21:43 Dekins, the merchant, is dead this afternoon, for grief that his daughter, my Morena, who has long been ill, is given over by the Doctors.

1662-10-03 13:07 Dined with my wife upon herrings, the first I have eat this year, and so to my workmen again.

1662-10-02 16:49 Here we saw “The Cardinall,” a tragedy I had never seen before, nor is there any great matter in it.

1662-10-02 15:22 I could not see the King or Queene, but many of the fine ladies, who yet are really not so handsome generally as I used to take them to be.

1662-10-02 15:04 I did follow five gentlemen who were carried to a private door in a wall, and crept through and come into one of the boxes next the King’s.

1662-10-02 14:32 Hearing that there was a play at the Cockpit (and my Lord Sandwich, who came to town last night, at it), I do go thither.

1662-10-01 09:58 Home and with my wife to bed, the first time I have lain there these two months and more, which I am now glad to do again.

1662-10-01 05:55 Up with my mind pretty well at rest about my accounts and other business.
