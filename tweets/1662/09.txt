1662-09-07 21:52 To my office, to fit myself for waiting on the Duke to-morrow morning with the rest of our company, and so to my lodgings and to bed.

1662-09-07 18:52 Here were great store of great ladies, but very few handsome.

1662-09-07 18:11 In comes the King, and the Duke and his Duchess; they being all together, was such a sight as I never could have seen with so much leisure.

1662-09-07 17:48 Here I also saw Madam Castlemaine, and, which pleased me most, Mr. Crofts, the King’s bastard, a most pretty spark of about 15 years old.

1662-09-07 17:20 I did never see our Queen before; and though she be not very charming, yet she hath a good, modest, and innocent look, which is pleasing.

1662-09-07 17:07 Mr. Pierce the chyrurgeon took me into Somersett House; and into the Queen-Mother’s presence-chamber, where she was with our own Queen.

1662-09-07 15:23 I did no more, though I had so much a mind to it that I spent in my breeches.

1662-09-07 15:22 I went up to Sarah and played and talked with her and, God forgive me, did feel her; which I am much ashamed of.

1662-09-07 14:53 To my Lord’s, where nobody at home but a woman that let me in, and Sarah above.

1662-09-07 11:07 I heard a good sermon of the Dean of Ely’s, upon returning to the old ways, and a most excellent anthem, sung by Captain Cooke.

1662-09-06 17:22 I had my new key and the lock of my office door altered, having lost my key the other day, which vexed me.

1662-09-06 13:42 To Trinity House. We had a couple of venison pasties, of which I eat little, being almost cloyed, having been at five pasties in three days.

1662-09-06 12:03 So up and to my office, and then we met and sat till noon, very full of business.

1662-09-06 06:15 Lay long, that is, till 6 and past before I rose, in order to sweat a little away the cold which I was afraid I might have got yesterday.

1662-09-05 21:07 I this day heard that Mr. Martin Noell is knighted by the King, which I much wonder at; but yet he is certainly a very useful man.

1662-09-05 16:30 It pleased me to see how jealous Sir Williams both are of my going down to Woolwich, and doing my duty, and my dining with the Commission.

1662-09-05 10:20 I walked to Greenwich, and thence by water to Deptford, and examined some stores and did some of my own business in hastening my work there.

1662-09-05 06:35 Before the yacht got to Woolwich the Dutch beat them half-a-mile; which all our people are glad of.

1662-09-05 06:10 I saw the yacht lately built by our virtuosoes set out from Greenwich with the little Dutch bezan, to try for mastery.

1662-09-04 14:32 In 88, Queen Elisabeth had but 36 sail in the world; and ten rounds of powder was their allowance at that time against the Spaniard.

1662-09-04 14:28 Sir Wm. Compton I heard talk with great pleasure of the difference between the fleet now and in Queen Elisabeth’s days.

1662-09-04 13:39 We to the Trinity House, where we treated, very dearly, the officers of the Ordnance; where was Sir W. Compton and the rest.

1662-09-04 06:44 By water betimes to the Tower and so home, where I shifted myself, being to dine abroad, and so being also trimmed.

1662-09-03 16:32 To the office. We met and sold the Weymouth, Successe, and Fellowship hulkes, where pleasant to see how backward men are at first to bid.

1662-09-03 15:02 The Fanatiques and the Presbyters, that did intend to rise, did choose this day as the most auspicious in their endeavours against monarchy.

1662-09-03 09:10 It is the first pay that Mr. Coventry has been at, and I would be thought to be as much with Mr. Coventry as I can.

1662-09-03 08:42 I went over to Redriffe, and walked to Deptford, where I found Mr. Coventry and Sir W. Pen beginning the pay.

1662-09-03 05:22 Whereas I used to rise by four o’clock, it is not broad daylight now till after five o’clock, so that it is after five before I do rise.

1662-09-02 06:10 Up betimes and got myself ready alone, and so to my office, my mind much troubled for my key that I lost yesterday.

1662-09-01 18:42 My wife writes me from the country that her boy plays the rogue there, and she is weary of him, and complains also of her maid Sarah.

1662-09-01 16:12 It being a thing I hate in others, to be careless of keys, I thinking another not fit to be trusted that leaves a key behind their hole.

1662-09-01 16:08 To my office, but missing my key, which I had in my hand just now, makes me very angry and out of order.

1662-09-01 14:18 I removed all my goods out of Sir W. Pen’s house into one room at my house, and so I am to be quit of any further obligation to him.

1662-09-01 11:38 We played over some things of Locke’s that we used to play at sea, that pleased us well, being the first music I have heard a great while.

1662-09-01 09:28 We found the Duke going out by coach with his Duchess, and he told us he was to go abroad with the Queen to-day.

1662-09-01 08:30 With Sir W. Batten and Sir W. Pen by coach to St. James’s, this being the first day of our meeting there by the Duke’s order.
