1662-07-15 21:07 It fell a-raining, and the house being all open at top, it vexed me; but there was no help for it.

1662-07-15 18:10 Comes Mr. Cooper, and I took him by water on purpose to tell me things belonging to ships, which was time well spent.

1662-07-14 20:08 My house being this day almost quite untiled in order to its rising higher.

1662-07-14 10:48 I found the pageant in Cornhill taken down, which was pretty strange.

1662-07-14 09:33 To Thames Street along with old Mr. Green, among the tarr-men, and did instruct myself in the nature and prices of tarr.

1662-07-13 18:18 I did discourse with Mr. Turner about the faults of our management of the business of our office, but I believe is a very knave.

1662-07-13 14:59 I set about making my chamber fit against to-morrow to have the people come to work in pulling down the top of my house.

1662-07-13 11:49 Having by some mischance hurt my cods, I had my old pain all yesterday and this morning, and so kept my bed all this morning.

1662-07-12 07:28 I put things in my house in order to be laid up, against my workmen come to take down the top of my house, which troubles me to think of it.

1662-07-11 13:38 To the Ropeyard, and viewed the hemp, wherein we found great corruption, and then saw a trial between Sir R. Ford’s yarn and our own.

1662-07-11 10:59 To Mr. Ackworth’s and Sheldon’s to view their books, which we found not to answer the King’s service and security at all as to the stores.

1662-07-11 09:24 To Woolwich, and viewed well all the houses and stores there, which lie in very great confusion for want of storehouses.

1662-07-11 07:53 We down to Deptford, and viewed some deals served in at a low price, which our officers, like knaves, would untruly value in their worth.

1662-07-11 05:13 Up by four o’clock, and hard at my multiplicacion-table, which I am now almost master of, and so made me ready and to my office.

1662-07-10 11:09 To the office, but it vexes me to see so much disorder at our table, that, every man minding a several business, we dispatch nothing.

1662-07-10 05:57 I did call my wife and Sarah, and did make up a difference between them, for she is so good a servant as I am loth to part with her.

1662-07-09 15:49 I would have my wife go to Brampton but for the cost. To stay here will be inconvenient because of the dirt when my house is pulled down.

1662-07-09 11:38 I did, God forgive me! promise Sir W. Pen all my service and love, though the rogue knows he deserves none, nor do I intend to show him any.

1662-07-09 04:27 Up by four o’clock, and at my multiplicacion-table hard, which is all the trouble I meet withal in my arithmetique.

1662-07-08 17:02 My Lord do seem to have his old confidence in me; and tells me to boot, that Mr. Coventry hath spoke of me to him to great advantage.

1662-07-07 12:10 My morning’s work was to put the new books of my office into order, and writing on the backsides what books they be.

1662-07-06 17:48 My Lady Castlemaine is still great with the King, and the King comes as often to her as ever he did, at which, God forgive me, I am pleased.

1662-07-06 09:08 I do see that my kitchen, besides wine, fire, candle, sope, and many other things, comes to about 30s. a week, or a little over.

1662-07-06 09:05 Lay long in bed to-day with my wife merry and pleasant, and then rose and settled my accounts with my wife for housekeeping.

1662-07-05 21:20 At my office all the afternoon, and then my mathematiques at night with Mr. Cooper, and so to supper and to bed.

1662-07-05 14:38 It is considerable that my mind was never in my life in so good a condition of quiet as it has been since I have followed my business.

1662-07-05 14:32 Mr. Creed would, with all his rhetoric, have persuaded me to have gone to a play; but I did refuse it, and I hope shall ever do so.

1662-07-05 13:44 I having some venison given me, and so I had a shoulder roasted, another baked, and the umbles baked in a pie, and all very well done.

1662-07-05 12:23 We had Sir W. Pen, who I hate with all my heart for his base treacherous tricks, but yet I think it not policy to declare it yet, to dinner.

1662-07-04 17:10 I sent my brother Tom, at his request, my father’s old Bass Viall which he and I have kept so long but I fear Tom will do little good at it.

1662-07-04 14:22 Sir W. Warren and I fell to discourse of Sir W. Batten’s corruption and the people that he employs, and from one discourse to another.

1662-07-04 12:05 Sir W. Warren did come to me, and did begin to instruct me in the nature of fine timber and deals, telling me the nature of every sort.

1662-07-04 07:50 After an hour’s being with Mr. Cooper at arithmetique (my first attempt being to learn the multiplication-table); we parted till to-morrow.

1662-07-04 06:42 Comes Mr Cooper, mate of the Royall Charles, of whom I intend to learn mathematiques and do begin with him to-day, he being a very able man.

1662-07-03 21:00 After a turn upon the leads with my wife, who has lately had but little of my company, since I begun to follow my business, and so to bed.

1662-07-03 19:17 Mr. Lewis did tell me how the Chest hath ever been abused and what a meritorious act it would be to look after it which I am resolved to do.

1662-07-03 15:13 After dinner was brought to Sir W. Compton a gun to discharge seven times, the best of all devices that ever I saw, and not a bawble.

1662-07-03 14:21 Dined at the Dolphin where Sir W. Compton, and other great persons, were, and a very great dinner, but I drank but my allowance of wine.

1662-07-03 09:10 To the office, where another fray between Sir R. Ford and myself about his yarn, wherein I find the board to yield on my side.

1662-07-03 06:55 Writing over our contract with Sir W. Rider, for 500 ton of hempe, which, because it is a secret, I have the trouble of writing over.

1662-07-02 13:40 I was sorry to see my Lord Sandwich’s people so peremptory, and at every word would complain, as if they shall have such a command over him.

1662-07-02 12:15 Pett and I to the Pay, where Sir Williams both were paying off the Royal James still, and so to dinner, and to the Pay again.

1662-07-01 18:10 To Redriffe by land, Mr. Cowly, the Clerk of the Cheque, discoursing concerning the abuses of the yard, in which he did give me much light.

1662-07-01 15:21 I spoke to Cooper about teaching the mathematiques. I please myself in thoughts of learning of him, and bade him come to me in a day or two.
