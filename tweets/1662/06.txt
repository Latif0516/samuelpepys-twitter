1662-06-15 19:53 I forbore to advise my wife till she could certainly tell me how things are with her brother, being loth to meddle too soon with him.

1662-06-15 19:48 My wife told me that her brother was married and had a wife worth 500l and did inquire how he might dispose the money to the best advantage.

1662-06-15 17:32 By and by my wife comes again, and, after a word or two, good friends.

1662-06-15 17:03 Home, and found my wife and Sarah gone to a neighbour church, at which I was not much displeased.

1662-06-15 14:38 To church; but my wife not being dressed as I would have her, I was angry, and she returned home again vexed.

1662-06-14 16:08 We had news that the Spaniard is before Lisbon with thirteen sail; six Dutch, and the rest his own ships; which will be ill for Portugall.

1662-06-14 14:48 My Lord Peterborough is come unexpected from Tangier, to give the King an account of the place, which is in none of the best condition.

1662-06-14 12:14 One asked Sir Henry Vane why he did not pray for the King. He answered, “Nay, you shall see I can pray for the King: I pray God bless him!”

1662-06-14 12:08 Sir Henry Vane changed not his colour or speech to the last, but died justifying himself and the cause he had stood for.

1662-06-14 11:45 Sir Henry Vane prayed, and so fitted himself, and received the blow; but the scaffold was so crowded that we could not see it done.

1662-06-14 11:28 Sir Henry Vane made a long speech, interrupted by the Sheriff; they would have taken his paper out of his hand, but he would not let it go.

1662-06-14 11:07 We all went out to the Tower-hill; and there, over against the scaffold, made on purpose this day, saw Sir Henry Vane brought.

1662-06-13 20:08 My wife and I, and Sarah and the boy, a most pleasant walk to Halfway house, and so home and to bed.

1662-06-13 04:29 More I discern therein than ever I thought was to be found in Cicero; but I perceive that he is as good a writer as ever I read in my life.

1662-06-13 04:25 Up by 4 o’clock in the morning, and read Cicero’s Second Oration against Catiline, which pleased me exceedingly.

1662-06-12 20:31 It being the longest day in the year, I made all my people go to bed by daylight.

1662-06-12 15:02 To the Dolphin, where a good dinner; but what is to myself a wonder; that with ease I past the whole dinner without drinking a drop of wine.

1662-06-12 10:06 It is to plead for my clerks to have their right of giving out all warrants, at which I am not a little pleased.

1662-06-12 10:04 At the office I did get a vote signed by all, concerning my issuing of warrants, which they did not smell the use I intend to make of it.

1662-06-12 06:08 I tried on my riding cloth suit with close knees, the first that ever I had; and I think they will be very convenient.

1662-06-11 18:48 Savill the Paynter came and did varnish over my wife’s picture and mine, and I paid him for my little picture 3l, and so am clear with him.

1662-06-11 15:45 I am vexed with all my heart at Pall for writing to my father so much concerning my mother’s illness (which I believe was not so great).

1662-06-11 15:38 I had a letter from my father that he is got down well, and found my mother pretty well again.

1662-06-11 12:18 Mr. Hater and I writing over my Alphabet fair, in which I took pleasure to rule the lines and to have the capitall words wrote with red ink.

1662-06-10 17:03 I had a mind to have bought the King’s works, new printed in folio, and present it to my Lord; I think it will be best to save the money.

1662-06-10 16:58 I went to my bookseller’s, and paid off all for books to this day, and do not intend to buy any more of any kind a good while.

1662-06-10 11:51 At the office all the morning, much business; and great hopes of bringing things, by Mr Coventry’s means, to a good condition in the office.

1662-06-09 16:07 Greatorex recommended Bond, of our end of the town, to teach me to measure timber, and some other things that I would learn.

1662-06-09 07:09 Making my alphabet of contracts, upon the dispatch of which I am now intent for that I am resolved to enquire into the price of commodities.

1662-06-08 20:49 I did ask Will where he learned that immodest garb. He answered me that it was not immodest, at which I did give him two boxes on the ears.

1662-06-08 20:28 I observe my man Will to walk with his cloak flung over his shoulder, like a Ruffian, which I was vexed at.

1662-06-08 18:08 To my Lady’s, and merry, among other things, with the parrott which my Lord hath brought from the sea, which speaks very well.

1662-06-07 19:03 Were it not that Mr. Coventry had already feathered his nest in selling of places, Sir G. Carteret do like him very well.

1662-06-07 17:29 I am afraid now to bring in any accounts for journeys, and so will others I suppose be, because of Mr. Coventry’s prying into them.

1662-06-07 17:26 My mind in great trouble whether I should go as I intended to Hampton Court to-morrow or no.

1662-06-07 13:59 Sir J. Robinson, Lieutenant of the Tower, says that yesterday Sir H. Vane had a full hearing at the King’s Bench, and is found guilty.

1662-06-07 11:26 To the office, and I find Mr. Coventry is resolved to do much good, and to enquire into all the miscarriages of the office.

1662-06-06 15:58 I hope it is otherwise, the letter being four days old since it was writ.

1662-06-06 15:57 To my brother Tom’s, where we found a letter from Pall that my mother is dangerously ill in fear of death, which troubles my father and me.

1662-06-06 12:07 To the Wardrobe to meet my father, who was well treated by my Lady, who tells me she has thoughts to send her boys to our house at Brampton.

1662-06-06 10:37 The smith did open a chest in my office, and we found a modell of a fine ship, which I long to know whether it be the King’s or Mr Turner’s.

1662-06-05 14:28 I was called from dinner to see some thousands of my Lord’s crusados weighed, and we find that 3,000 come to about 530l. or 40 generally.

1662-06-05 09:03 To the office, and I showed them yesterday’s discovery, and have got Sir R. Ford to be my enemy by it; but I care not, for it is my duty.

1662-06-04 15:09 I to my Lord’s, who I find resolved to buy Brampton Manor of Sir Peter Ball, at which I am glad.

1662-06-04 10:03 I was glad of this discovery, because I would not have the King’s workmen discouraged from representing the faults of merchants’ goods.

1662-06-04 09:48 Some of Sir R. Ford’s yarn had old stuff that had been tarred, covered over with new hemp, which is such a cheat as hath not been heard of.

1662-06-04 09:44 We saw an experiment made of Holland’s yarn. We found it to be bad, and broke sooner than five threads of that against four of Riga yarn.

1662-06-03 22:15 I made the maids to rise and light a candle, and set it in the dining-room, to scare away thieves, and so to sleep.

1662-06-03 21:56 Home and to bed, my mind troubled about Sir W. Pen, his playing the rogue with me, as also about the charge of money that is in my house.

1662-06-03 17:39 Yesterday the Aldermen of the City did attend the Queen in their habits, and did present her with a gold Cupp and 1000l. in gold therein.

1662-06-03 16:41 I found my Lady come from Hampton Court, where the Queen hath used her civilly; my Lady tells me is a most pretty woman, at which I am glad.

1662-06-03 13:49 Mr. Creed and Shepley were ready with three chests of the crusados, being about 6000l, to bring to my house, which they put it in my cellar.

1662-06-03 09:54 It was ruled for me. Sir W. Pen did it like a base raskall, and so I shall remember him while I live.

1662-06-03 09:32 Upon our making a contract, I went to draw the heads thereof, but Sir W. Pen most basely told me that the Comptroller is to do it.

1662-06-03 04:51 To my business in my chamber, to even accounts, and very fain I would become master of 1000l, but I have not above 530l. toward it yet.

1662-06-02 20:12 This day my wife put on her slasht wastecoate, which is very pretty.

1662-06-02 14:49 We found Mrs. Clarke in a dishabille, intending to go to Hampton Court to-morrow. We had much pretty discourse, and a very fine lady she is.

1662-06-02 14:33 My wife and I to Mrs. Clarke’s at Westminster, the first visit that ever we both made her yet.

1662-06-02 08:28 To the Wardrobe with Mr. Moore, and spoke to my Lord about the exchange of the crusados into sterling money, and other matters.

1662-06-01 15:22 To church, where a Presbyter made a sad and long sermon, which vexed me.
