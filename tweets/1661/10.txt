1661-10-17 13:49 The King of Portugall is a very rude and simple fellow and, for reviling of somebody a little while ago, was run into the cods with a sword.

1661-10-17 13:35 Dined with Captain Lambert, and had much talk of Portugall; from whence he is lately come, and he tells me it is a very poor dirty place.

1661-10-17 10:28 Captain Cock was confident that the Parliament would bring trouble with it, and enquire how the King had disposed of offices and money.

1661-10-16 14:12 Dined with me, Dr Thos. Pepys, my Coz Snow, and my brother Tom, upon a fin of ling and some sounds, neither of which did I ever know before.

1661-10-16 13:00 Came several maids to be hired. My wife pitched upon one Nell who would not be hired under half a year, which I am pleased at her drollness.

1661-10-16 12:06 In bed till 12 o’clock.

1661-10-15 16:37 Home in much pain. By walking too much yesterday I have made my testicle to swell again, which much troubles me.

1661-10-14 20:07 Lord! what a sad story Mr. Pim makes of his being abused by a Dr. of Physique who is in one part of the tenement wherein he dwells.

1661-10-14 18:48 Mr. Pim went with us to the Fountain and did give us store of wine. It being the Duke of York’s birthday we drank the more to his health.

1661-10-14 13:45 To the Wardrobe, and dined with my Lady, the first time I have seen her dine abroad since her being brought to bed of my Lady Katherine.

1661-10-13 20:14 Did not stir out all day, but dined below. Left off half skirts and put on a wastecoate, and my false taby wastecoate with gold lace.

1661-10-12 16:25 In bed the greatest part of this day also, and my swelling in some measure gone. 

1661-10-12 12:02 Sir R. Bernard do fear that my uncle has not observed the custom of Brampton in his will, which puts me to a great trouble in mind.

1661-10-11 23:03 To bed again in more ease than last night.

1661-10-11 18:12 All day in bed with a cataplasm to my Codd.

1661-10-10 22:08 Yet my wife and I pretty merry.

1661-10-10 22:05 Intended to be merry, it being my sixth wedding night; but by a bruise in one of my testicles I am in so much pain that I in pain to bed.

1661-10-10 17:48 Sir W. Pen, my wife and I to the Theatre, where the King came and there was “The Traytor” most admirably acted; a most excellent play it is.

1661-10-09 12:04 I found Mrs Pierce, la belle, and Madam Clifford, and made them welcome; I was (God knows) very well pleased with their beautiful company.

1661-10-09 10:43 Went out about my affairs, among others to put my Theorbo out to be mended.

1661-10-08 18:10 Took Mrs. Martha to the Theatre in a frolique, to my great expense, and shewed her part of the “Beggar’s Bush,” without much pleasure.

1661-10-08 16:04 Went and eat some Colchester oysters with Sir W. Batten at his house, and there dined and staid there talking all the afternoon.

1661-10-07 20:22 Troubled in my mind till I can hear from Brampton, how things go on at Sturtlow, at the Court.

1661-10-06 11:47 Mrs. Margaret Pen this day come to church in a new flowered satin suit that my wife helped to buy her the other day.

1661-10-06 11:38 The three sisters, the Thornburys, a fine, and the most zealous people that ever I saw in my life, even to admiration, if it were true zeal.

1661-10-06 11:28 To church; Mr. Mills preached, who, I expect, should take in snuffe that my wife not come to his child’s christening the other day.

1661-10-05 21:30 Sir W. Pen and I alone to the Dolphin, and there eat some bloat-herrings and drank good sack.

1661-10-05 17:22 Staid at home all the afternoon putting up my Lord’s model of the Royal James, which I borrowed of him long ago to hang up in my room.

1661-10-04 20:42 Home, where I found my wife vexed at her people for grumbling to eat Suffolk cheese, which I also am vexed at.

1661-10-04 17:04 Captain Ferrers and I to the Theatre, and came too late, so we saw a bit of “Victoria,” which pleased me worse than it did the other day.

1661-10-03 21:06 My Lady Batten had yesterday been at the play where we were, and it was good sport to hear how she talked of it with admiration like a fool.

1661-10-02 17:49 Sitting in an ill place I never had so little pleasure in a play in my life, yet it was the first time that I saw it, “Victoria Corombona.”

1661-10-02 11:54 The slut is like to prove so troublesome that I am out of heart with troubling myself in her business.

1661-10-02 11:52 All this morning at Pegg Kite’s with my uncle Fenner, and two friends of his, appraising her goods that her mother has left.

1661-10-01 20:44 To my study to set matters and papers in order, which, though I can hardly bring myself to do, yet do please me much when it is done.

1661-10-01 08:32 Word was brought me that my singing master, Mr. Goodgroome, was come to teach me and so my wife rose and this morning began to learn also.

1661-10-01 08:09 My wife and I fell into talk of musique, and desired that I would let her learn to sing, which I did consider, and promised her she should.
