1661-10-08 18:10 Took Mrs. Martha to the Theatre in a frolique, to my great expense, and shewed her part of the “Beggar’s Bush,” without much pleasure.

1661-10-08 16:04 Went and eat some Colchester oysters with Sir W. Batten at his house, and there dined and staid there talking all the afternoon.

1661-10-07 20:22 Troubled in my mind till I can hear from Brampton, how things go on at Sturtlow, at the Court.

1661-10-06 11:47 Mrs. Margaret Pen this day come to church in a new flowered satin suit that my wife helped to buy her the other day.

1661-10-06 11:38 The three sisters, the Thornburys, a fine, and the most zealous people that ever I saw in my life, even to admiration, if it were true zeal.

1661-10-06 11:28 To church; Mr. Mills preached, who, I expect, should take in snuffe that my wife not come to his child’s christening the other day.

1661-10-05 21:30 Sir W. Pen and I alone to the Dolphin, and there eat some bloat-herrings and drank good sack.

1661-10-05 17:22 Staid at home all the afternoon putting up my Lord’s model of the Royal James, which I borrowed of him long ago to hang up in my room.

1661-10-04 20:42 Home, where I found my wife vexed at her people for grumbling to eat Suffolk cheese, which I also am vexed at.

1661-10-04 17:04 Captain Ferrers and I to the Theatre, and came too late, so we saw a bit of “Victoria,” which pleased me worse than it did the other day.

1661-10-03 21:06 My Lady Batten had yesterday been at the play where we were, and it was good sport to hear how she talked of it with admiration like a fool.

1661-10-02 17:49 Sitting in an ill place I never had so little pleasure in a play in my life, yet it was the first time that I saw it, “Victoria Corombona.”

1661-10-02 11:54 The slut is like to prove so troublesome that I am out of heart with troubling myself in her business.

1661-10-02 11:52 All this morning at Pegg Kite’s with my uncle Fenner, and two friends of his, appraising her goods that her mother has left.

1661-10-01 20:44 To my study to set matters and papers in order, which, though I can hardly bring myself to do, yet do please me much when it is done.

1661-10-01 08:32 Word was brought me that my singing master, Mr. Goodgroome, was come to teach me and so my wife rose and this morning began to learn also.

1661-10-01 08:09 My wife and I fell into talk of musique, and desired that I would let her learn to sing, which I did consider, and promised her she should.
