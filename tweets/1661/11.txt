1661-11-07 20:10 Letters from my Lord from Lisbone. He tells me he had seen at the court there the day before he wrote this letter, the Juego de Toro.

1661-11-07 19:32 My uncle Fenner tells that Peg Kite hath declared she will have the beggarly rogue the weaver, and so we are resolved not to meddle.

1661-11-07 09:03 Came one Mr. Hill, to teach me to play on the Theorbo, but I do not like his play nor singing, and so I found a way to put him off.

1661-11-06 19:40 I endeavoured to speak with Tom Trice (who I fear is hatching some mischief), but could not, which vexed me.

1661-11-06 12:20 To Nick Osborne’s at the Victualling Office, and saw his wife, who he has lately married, a good sober woman, and new come to their home.

1661-11-06 09:05 I met Mr. Davenport and a friend of his, to drink their morning draft with me, and I did give it them in wine, and anchovies, and oysters.

1661-11-05 23:05 Called at my Lady Batten’s again and would have gone to cards, but Sir W. Pen was so fuddled that we could not try him to play.

1661-11-05 22:40 To the Dolphin, where we drank much, seeing the boys in the streets flying their crackers, this day being kept very strictly in the City.

1661-11-05 15:27 After dinner, I having drunk a great deal of wine, I went away, seeming to go about business, to my Lady Batten’s, and there sat a while.

1661-11-05 12:05 I find Mr. Armiger inviting my wife to go to a play, and like a fool would be courting her, but he is an ass.

1661-11-04 17:42 To our thinking not so well acted here (having great expectations). But for Betterton he is called by us both the best actor in the world.

1661-11-04 17:39 To the Opera, where we saw “The Bondman,” which of old we both did so doat on, and do still.

1661-11-04 13:20 I to the Mitre (Mr. Rawlinson’s), where Mr. Pierce, the Purser, had got us a most brave chine of beef, and a dish of marrowbones.

1661-11-03 20:50 My wife and I had a good supper of a pullet hashed, which pleased me much to see my condition come to allow ourselves a dish like that.

1661-11-03 18:32 I did try to make a song in the praise of a liberall genius (as I take my own to be) to all studies and pleasures.

1661-11-03 17:49 All the day as I was at leisure I did read in Fuller’s Holy Warr, which I have of late bought.

1661-11-03 17:33 This day I stirred not out, but took physique, and it did work very well.

1661-11-02 21:32 Though it did trouble me to beat my boy Wayneman, yet I thought it necessary to do it. So to write by the post, and to bed.

1661-11-02 21:18 Upon examination, and finding Wayneman in a lie about the time and place that he bought the gunpowder, I did extremely beat him.

1661-11-02 21:14 The match did give fire to the powder, and had burnt his side and his hand that he put into his pocket to put out the fire.

1661-11-02 21:12 Hearing a noise made, I call Wayneman up, and find that it was powder that he had put in his pocket, and a match carelessly with it.

1661-11-02 21:10 My boy Wayneman, as I was in my chamber, I overheard him let off some gunpowder.

1661-11-02 15:20 I to the Wardrobe, and there dined, and had an hour or two’s talk with my Lady with great pleasure.

1661-11-02 10:30 The first time that Sir John Minnes had come hither, and he seems a good fair condition man, and one that I am glad hath the office.

1661-11-02 10:05 Sir John Minnes, our new comptroller, was fetched by Sir Wm. Pen and myself from Sir Wm. Batten’s, and led to his place in the office.

1661-11-01 22:20 At my house we were very merry till late, having sent for Sir W. Pen’s son, Mr. William Pen, lately come from Oxford.

1661-11-01 13:40 Had the maister and his fayre sister (who is very great with Sir W. Batten and Sir W. Pen in mirth) up to us, and looked over some medals.

1661-11-01 12:55 To the 3 Tun Tavern, at Charing Cross, and there sent for up the maister of the house’s dinner, and dined very well upon it.
