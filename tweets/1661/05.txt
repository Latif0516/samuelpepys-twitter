1661-05-08 20:42 It vexed me to see how my uncle writes to me, as if he were not able to buy my Cozen Perkin a fiddle. But I intend tomorrow to send him one.

1661-05-08 20:40 A letter from my uncle, to beg a fiddle for my Cozen Perkin, whose mill hath lately broke down. Now he hath nothing to live by but fiddling.

1661-05-08 19:10 Comes my wife not well, having had a tooth drawn out to-day, which do trouble me, the more because I am now in the greatest of all my dirt.

1661-05-08 18:20 All this day I staid at home with my workmen without eating anything, and took much pleasure to see my work go forward.

1661-05-08 08:20 Came my brother John to take his leave of me, he being to return to Cambridge. I did give him good counsell and 20s, and so he went away.

1661-05-07 21:10 Sent my Lord a letter to excuse myself for not going to-morrow to the Hope, whither he is to go to see in what condition the fleet is in.

1661-05-07 18:10 Home and staid among my workmen all day, and took order for things for the finishing of their work.

1661-05-07 14:00 An excellent droll, my host, his wife so fine a woman; sung and played so well that I staid a great while and drunk a great deal of wine.

1661-05-07 13:40 Mr. Creed carried me to an ordinary by the Old Exchange, where we come a little too late, but we had very good cheer for our 18d. a-piece.

1661-05-07 09:40 We were stopped by the City traynebands, who go in solemnity and pomp to muster before the King and the Duke. Shops are shut up every where.

1661-05-06 21:50 I hear that the Duke of York’s son is dead, which I believe will please every body; the Duke and his Lady are not much troubled at it.

1661-05-06 21:20 I went and sat till late with my Lady Batten, both the Sir Williams being gone this day to pay off some ships at Deptford.

1661-05-06 12:00 Home, where I was much troubled to see no more work done in my absence than there was, but it could not be helped.

1661-05-05 21:10 In the banquet house my wife and I did talk high, she against and I for Mrs. Pierce (that she was a beauty), till we were both angry.

1661-05-05 15:40 In the garden we played the fool a great while, trying who of Mr. Creed or I could go best over the edge of an old fountain well.

1661-05-05 11:30 Mr. Creed and I went to the red-faced Parson’s church, and heard a good sermon of him, better than I looked for.

1661-05-04 22:15 We lay at the Red Lyon, the best Inn, and lay in the room the King lately lay in.

1661-05-04 22:00 So to supper being very merry about our discourse with the Drawers concerning the minister of the Town, with a red face and a girdle.

1661-05-04 17:00 And so to Gilford. We had time to see the Hospital, built by Archbishop Abbott, and the free school and were civilly treated by the Mayster.

1661-05-03 22:20 Here my wife and I lay in the room the Queen lately lay at her going into France.

1661-05-03 17:30 To Petersfield, having nothing more of trouble in all my journey, but the exceeding unmannerly and most epicure-like palate of Mr. Creed.

1661-05-03 13:10 To the payhouse, and paid off the ship, and so to a short dinner. Then took coach, leaving Mrs. Hater to stay with her husband’s friends.

1661-05-03 07:50 To walk with Mr. Creed, and it was in his and some others’ thoughts to have got me made free of the town but the Mayor, it seems, unwilling.

1661-05-02 16:20 To see the Montagu, which is a fine ship, and so to the town again, then to see the room where the Duke of Buckingham was killed by Felton.

1661-05-02 15:40 Brought them all to dinner with me, and treated them handsomely; after dinner to the Yard, and there we made the sale of the old provisions.

1661-05-02 11:10 All the officers of the Yard to see me with great respect, and I walked with them to the Dock, and much pleased with the sight of the place.

1661-05-01 21:20 Several officers of the Yard came to see us to-night, and merry we were, but troubled to have no better lodgings.

1661-05-01 13:50 We set forth again, and so to Portsmouth, seeming to me to be a very pleasant and strong place.

1661-05-01 10:00 Bated at Petersfield, in the room which the King lay in lately at his being there. Here very merry, and played us and our wives at bowls.
