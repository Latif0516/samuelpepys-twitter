1661-09-11 21:27 My wife was with her brother to see his mistress today, and says she is young, rich, and handsome, but not likely for him to get.

1661-09-11 18:30 I went home with my mind troubled for my going thither, after my swearing to my wife that I would never go to a play without her.

1661-09-11 17:55 I, against my own mind and resolution, could not forbear to go in which did make the play seem a burthen to me and I took no pleasure in it.

1661-09-11 15:09 Dr. Williams and I walking through Lincoln’s Fields observed at the Opera a new play, “Twelfth Night” was acted there, and the King there.

1661-09-11 08:24 The cats shall be quite covered; that if but the tip of the tail hangs out the dog will take up the cat again, and dig the hole deeper.

1661-09-09 22:14 I believe when Sir W. Pen do come to understand it he will be angry, he has so talked of the business himself and the letter up and down.

1661-09-09 22:08 We begun to tell Sir W. Pen the business, but he had been drinking to-day, and so is almost gone, that we could not make him understand it.

1661-09-09 19:10 Found Sir Williams both and more company gone to the Dolphin to drink the 30s. that we got the other day of Sir W. Pen about his tankard.

1661-09-08 21:33 Upon the whole I do find myself, by what I can yet see, worth near 600l., for which God be blessed, which put me into great comfort.

1661-09-08 18:22 It always was, and I fear will ever be, my foible that after I am got behind-hand with business, I am hard to set to it again to recover it.

1661-09-08 18:10 Up to my chamber all alone, and troubled in mind to think how much of late I have addicted myself to expense and pleasure.

1661-09-08 16:24 Found our new maid Doll asleep, that she could not hear to let us in. We were fain to send the boy in at a window to open the door to us.

1661-09-07 20:54 “Bartholomew Fayre” had not been acted these forty years, it being so satyricall against Puritanism, they durst not till now.

1661-09-07 20:45 Here was “Bartholomew Fayre,” with the puppet-show, acted, but I do never a whit like it the better for the puppets, but rather the worse.

1661-09-07 16:45 To the Theatre, where we seated ourselves close by the King, and Duke of York, and Madame Palmer; I can never enough admire her beauty.

1661-09-06 09:32 My wife holding her resolution to go, and though there could not be much hurt in it, yet my own jealousy put a hundred things into my mind.

1661-09-05 20:33 My wife and I to the fair, and I showed her the Italians dancing the ropes, and the women that do strange tumbling tricks

1661-09-05 14:20 My aunt Kite is sick ready to die and sends for my uncle and me to come to take charge of things, and to be entrusted with her daughter.

1661-09-05 12:18 My wife promised to go to some place to-morrow morning, which do trouble my mind how to know whither it was.

1661-09-03 11:55 Some of us Commissioners went down to Deptford to pay off some ships, but I could not go, but staid at home setting papers to rights.

1661-09-02 21:49 I sent another letter to Sir W. Pen to offer him the return of his tankard upon his leaving of 30s. at a place where it should be brought.

1661-09-02 19:44 My wife met with Mr Somerset, who did give her a bracelet of rings, which did a little trouble me, though I know there is no hurt yet in it.

1661-09-02 17:04 Mr. Pickering tells me of the vices of the Court, and how the pox is so common there, and that it is as common as eating and swearing.

1661-09-02 16:38 Mr. Pickering be a fool, yet he keeps much company, and will tell all he hears, so a man may understand what the common talk of the town is.

1661-09-02 13:08 To the Rhenish wine house where the master of the house is making a cellar with an arch in his yard, which is very convenient for him.

1661-09-01 17:48 Good God! what an age is this, and what a world is this! that a man cannot live without playing the knave and dissimulation.

1661-09-01 17:44 Captain Holmes is one that can put on two several faces, and look his enemies in the face with as much love as his friends.

1661-09-01 14:24 The tankard was stole by Sir W. Batten, and the letter, as from the thief, wrote by me, which makes very good sport.

1661-09-01 14:22 We were very merry with Sir W. Pen about the loss of his tankard, though all be but a cheat, and he do not yet understand it.

1661-09-01 06:30 Last night being very rainy [the rain] broke into my house, the gutter being stopped, and spoiled all my ceilings almost.
