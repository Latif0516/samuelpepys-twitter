1661-01-18 21:50 Took home with me from the bookseller’s Ogilby’s Æsop, which he had bound for me, and indeed I am very much pleased with the book.

1661-01-18 21:00 Mr. Hollier did advise me, both as to the stone and the decay of my memory, to avoid drinking often, which I am resolved to leave off.

1661-01-18 20:10 In comes Will Joyce to us drunk, and in a talking vapouring humour of his state, and I know not what, which did vex me cruelly.

1661-01-18 11:45 At home found all well, but the monkey loose, which did anger me. I did strike her till she was almost dead, that they might make her fast.

1661-01-18 11:00 After a morning draft I took horse and guide for London; and through some rain, and a wind in my face, I got to London at eleven o’clock.

1661-01-17 22:30 To bed, the page and I in one bed, and the two captains in another, where we had very good mirth with our most abominable lodging.

1661-01-17 20:30 At supper my Lady and I entered into a great dispute concerning what were best for a man to do with his estate.

1661-01-17 16:50 It begun to be dark before we come to Dartford, and the horses to fayle, which was our care to prevent, for fear of my Lord’s displeasure.

1661-01-17 11:50 From thence on board the Newcastle, to show my Lady the difference between a great and a small ship.

1661-01-17 11:00 I confess it was a great pleasure to myself to see the ship that I begun my good fortune in.

1661-01-17 10:20 The officers of the ship had prepared a handsome breakfast for my Lady, and while she was pledging my Lord’s health they give her five guns.

1661-01-17 09:50 Thence to the Charles, where my Lady took great pleasure to see all the rooms, and to hear me tell her how things are when my Lord is there.

1661-01-17 09:10 We went through Ham Creeke to the Soverayne (a goodly sight all the way to see the brave ships that lie here), which is a most noble ship.

1661-01-16 18:30 The sport was how my Lady had intended to keep herself unknown, and how the Captain of the Charles had forsoothed her, though he knew her.

1661-01-16 18:00 I found my Lady and her daughter Jem, and Mrs. Browne, all at a great loss, not finding me here, but at my coming she was overjoyed.

1661-01-16 10:50 I did not know what to do, being loth to follow my Lady, and yet could not imagine what she would do when she found me not there.

1661-01-16 10:10 I to wait upon my Lady; but coming to her lodgings I find that she is gone this morning to Chatham by coach, thinking to meet me there.

1661-01-15 22:40 Comes in my boy and tells me that his mistress do lie at Mrs. Hunt’s, who is very ill, with which being something satisfied, I went to bed.

1661-01-15 22:00 My wife not yet come home, so I went up to put my papers in order, and then was much troubled my wife was not come, it being 10 o’clock.

1661-01-15 18:20 I perceive none of our officers care much for one another, but I do keep in with them all as much as I can.

1661-01-15 15:10 To Blackwall and viewed the dock and the new Wet dock, and a new merchantman which is to be launched shortly, to be called the Royal Oak.

1661-01-15 14:30 We walked into the rope-yard, where I took great notice of all the several works belonging to the making of a cable.

1661-01-15 12:00 Up and down the yard all the morning and seeing the seamen exercise, which they do already very handsomely.

1661-01-14 22:20 I with Mr. Ackworth to his house, where he has a very proper lovely woman to his wife, who both sat with me in my chamber.

1661-01-14 19:50 To Mr. Pett’s, the shipwright, and there supped, his wife a proper woman, and has been handsome, and yet has a very pretty hand.

1661-01-14 11:50 I spent much time walking with Lieutenant Lambert, walking up and down the yards, who did give me much light into things there.

1661-01-13 22:55 At last we hear that it was only five or six men that did ride through the guard in the town, without stopping to the guard.

1661-01-13 22:42 Seamen of all the ships present repair to us, and there we armed with every one a handspike, with which they were as fierce as could be.

1661-01-13 22:30 No sooner in bed, but we had an alarm, and so we rose: and the Comptroller comes into the Yard to us.

1661-01-13 15:40 With Commissioner Petter and his wife to Greenwich Church, where a good sermon, a fine church, and a great company of handsome women.

1661-01-13 11:00 We all went to church, and sat in the pew belonging to us, where a cold sermon of a young man that never had preached before.

1661-01-12 20:00 I went home with Mr. Davis, storekeeper, and was prince-like lodged, with so much respect and honour I was at a loss how to behave myself.

1661-01-12 14:10 Never till now did I see the great authority of my place, all the captains of the fleet coming cap in hand to us.

1661-01-12 11:30 To Deptford, where we fell to choosing four captains to command the guards, and choosing the places where to keep them.

1661-01-12 09:10 Major Waters, a deaf and amorous melancholy gentleman, is under a despayr in love, which makes him bad company, though a good-natured man.

1661-01-11 19:00 Walked to Paul’s Churchyard, and bespoke some books against next week.

1661-01-11 13:50 Dined at home, discontented that my wife do not go neater now she has two maids.

1661-01-11 11:35 This news do make people think something indeed, that three of the Royal Family should fall sick of the same disease, one after another.

1661-01-11 11:20 Comes news that the Princess Henrietta is fallen sick of the meazles on board the London, after the Queen and she was under sail.

1661-01-10 19:25 A thing that never was heard of, that so few men should dare and do so much mischief.

1661-01-10 19:12 All these Fanatiques that have done all this are not in all about 31. Whereas we did believe them to be at least 500.

1661-01-10 19:00 Among other things Mr. Davis told us the particular examinations of these Fanatiques that are taken.

1661-01-10 15:40 I went with my wife to see Sir W. Pen, who we found ill still, but he do make very much of it.

1661-01-10 14:10 To Mrs. Hunt where I found a Frenchman, and as I came in was kissing my wife which I did not like, though there could not be any hurt in it.

1661-01-10 10:00 We both went forth and at the Hoop by the bridge we drank two pints of wormwood and sack.

1661-01-10 09:40 There comes Mr. Hawley to me and brings me my money for the quarter of a year’s salary of my place under Downing that I was at sea.

1661-01-09 22:50 Home to my lute till late, and then to bed, there being strict guards in the City, though most of the enemies are killed or taken.

1661-01-09 14:30 I found my uncle Wight at home and his wife, and I can see they have taken my absence ill, but all things are past and we good friends.

1661-01-09 12:00 Seeing the city in this condition, the shops shut, and all things in trouble, I went home and sat, it being office day, till noon.

1661-01-09 08:05 The streets full of Train-band, and great stories, what mischief these rogues have done; I think near a dozen have been killed this morning.

1661-01-09 07:50 I found Sir R. Ford, and with him I walked up and down as far as the Exchange, and there I left him.

1661-01-09 06:35 I returned (that I might not seem to be afeared), and got my sword and pistol, which, however, I had no powder to charge.

1661-01-09 06:20 In the street I found every body in arms at the doors.

1661-01-09 06:00 Waked by people running up and down in Mr. Davis’s house, talking that the Fanatiques were up in arms in the City.

1661-01-08 21:40 Some talk to-day of a head of Fanatiques that do appear about Barnett, but I do not believe it.

1661-01-08 18:10 My Lord’s coach waited for us, and so back to my Lady’s. She made me drink of some Florence wine, and did give me two bottles for my wife. 

1661-01-08 16:30 I shewed my Lord Hinchinbroke and Mr. Sidney “The Widdow,” an indifferent good play, but wronged by the women being to seek in their parts.

1661-01-08 09:40 My wife and I lay very long in bed to-day talking and pleasing one another in discourse.

1661-01-08 00:10 We found that my people had got young Davis and some other neighbours with them to be merry, but no harm.

1661-01-07 23:20 In our way home we were in places strictly examined, more than in the worst of times, there being fears of these Fanatiques rising again.

1661-01-07 17:12 Kinaston, the boy; had the good turn to appear in three shapes: as a poor woman, then in fine clothes as a gallant, and lastly, as a man.

1661-01-07 17:00 Tom and I and my wife to the Theatre, and there saw “The Silent Woman.” The first time that ever I did see it, and it is an excellent play.

1661-01-07 07:00 My Lord Mayor and the whole City had been in arms, above 40,000.

1661-01-07 06:45 News was brought to me that there had been a stir in the City this night by the Fanatiques, who had been up and killed six or seven men.

1661-01-06 17:30 After sermon home, and there I went to my chamber and wrote a letter to send to Mr. Coventry, with a piece of plate along with it.

1661-01-05 08:30 By coach home, staying a little in Paul’s Churchyard, to bespeak Ogilby’s Æsop’s Fables and Tully’s Officys to be bound for me.

1661-01-05 10:40 Several people came to me about business, among others the great Tom Fuller, who came to desire a kindness for a friend of his.

1661-01-04 20:40 My father told me how Will and Mary Joyce live a strange life, nothing but fighting, so that her father has a mind to have them divorced.

1661-01-04 17:20 After dinner Mr. Moore and I to the Theatre, where was “The Scornful Lady,” acted very well, it being the first play that ever he saw.

1661-01-04 08:25 I chose a gilt tankard, weighing 31 ounces and a half, and my Lord is allowed 30; so I paid 12s. for the ounce and half over.

1661-01-04 08:10 At the Jewell Office, to choose a piece of gilt plate for my Lord, in return of his offering to the King.

1661-01-03 19:20 To my father’s, where I found my mother gone by Bird, the carrier, to Brampton, upon my uncle’s desire, my aunt being in despair of life.

1661-01-03 17:10 To the Theatre, where was acted “Beggars’ Bush,” it being very well done; and here the first time that ever I saw women come upon the stage.

1661-01-03 08:00 To the Exchequer, where I told over what money I had of my Lord’s and my own there, which I found to be 970l.

1661-01-02 20:50 There stood a man at our door, when I carried the money in, and saw me, which made me a little afeard.

1661-01-02 20:20 To my Lord’s, and took my money I brought ‘thither last night and the silver candlesticks, and left the latter at Alderman Backwell’s.

1661-01-02 18:10 I took a turn in the Hall, and bought the King and Chancellor’s speeches at the dissolving the Parliament last Saturday.

1661-01-02 13:00 I found Pall (my sister) was come; but I do not let her sit down at table with me, which I do at first that she may not expect it hereafter.

1661-01-02 08:50 My Lord to White Hall stairs with much company, and I with him; where we took water for Lambeth, and there he by coach to Portsmouth.

1661-01-02 08:20 Up early, and being called up to my Lord he did give me many commands in his business.

1661-01-01 21:15 Mrs. Pierce is such a slut that I do not love her victualls.

1661-01-01 21:00 To Mr. Pierces, and there supped with them, where we had a calf’s head carboned, but it was raw, we could not eat it, and a good hen.

1661-01-01 16:50 Mr. Moore cast up the fees. One 100l. bag, after I had told it, fell all about the room, and I fear I have lost some of it.

1661-01-01 13:40 Thomas Pepys dinner a sorry, poor dinner for a man of his estate, there being nothing but ordinary meat in it.

1661-01-01 10:18 The Parliament beginning to grow factious, the King did dissolve it December 29th last, and another likely to be chosen speedily.

1661-01-01 10:05 The King settled, and loved of all. The Duke of York matched to my Lord Chancellor’s daughter, which do not please many.

1661-01-01 09:52 Myself in constant good health, and in a most handsome and thriving condition. Blessed be Almighty God for it.

1661-01-01 09:40 After much trouble with workmen I am almost settled; my family being, myself, my wife, Jane, Will. Hewer, and Wayneman, my girle’s brother.
