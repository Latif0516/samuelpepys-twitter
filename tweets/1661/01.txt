1661-01-10 19:25 A thing that never was heard of, that so few men should dare and do so much mischief.

1661-01-10 19:12 All these Fanatiques that have done all this are not in all about 31. Whereas we did believe them to be at least 500.

1661-01-10 19:00 Among other things Mr. Davis told us the particular examinations of these Fanatiques that are taken.

1661-01-10 15:40 I went with my wife to see Sir W. Pen, who we found ill still, but he do make very much of it.

1661-01-10 14:10 To Mrs. Hunt where I found a Frenchman, and as I came in was kissing my wife which I did not like, though there could not be any hurt in it.

1661-01-10 10:00 We both went forth and at the Hoop by the bridge we drank two pints of wormwood and sack.

1661-01-10 09:40 There comes Mr. Hawley to me and brings me my money for the quarter of a year’s salary of my place under Downing that I was at sea.

1661-01-09 22:50 Home to my lute till late, and then to bed, there being strict guards in the City, though most of the enemies are killed or taken.

1661-01-09 14:30 I found my uncle Wight at home and his wife, and I can see they have taken my absence ill, but all things are past and we good friends.

1661-01-09 12:00 Seeing the city in this condition, the shops shut, and all things in trouble, I went home and sat, it being office day, till noon.

1661-01-09 08:05 The streets full of Train-band, and great stories, what mischief these rogues have done; I think near a dozen have been killed this morning.

1661-01-09 07:50 I found Sir R. Ford, and with him I walked up and down as far as the Exchange, and there I left him.

1661-01-09 06:35 I returned (that I might not seem to be afeared), and got my sword and pistol, which, however, I had no powder to charge.

1661-01-09 06:20 In the street I found every body in arms at the doors.

1661-01-09 06:00 Waked by people running up and down in Mr. Davis’s house, talking that the Fanatiques were up in arms in the City.

1661-01-08 21:40 Some talk to-day of a head of Fanatiques that do appear about Barnett, but I do not believe it.

1661-01-08 18:10 My Lord’s coach waited for us, and so back to my Lady’s. She made me drink of some Florence wine, and did give me two bottles for my wife. 

1661-01-08 16:30 I shewed my Lord Hinchinbroke and Mr. Sidney “The Widdow,” an indifferent good play, but wronged by the women being to seek in their parts.

1661-01-08 09:40 My wife and I lay very long in bed to-day talking and pleasing one another in discourse.

1661-01-08 00:10 We found that my people had got young Davis and some other neighbours with them to be merry, but no harm.

1661-01-07 23:20 In our way home we were in places strictly examined, more than in the worst of times, there being fears of these Fanatiques rising again.

1661-01-07 17:12 Kinaston, the boy; had the good turn to appear in three shapes: as a poor woman, then in fine clothes as a gallant, and lastly, as a man.

1661-01-07 17:00 Tom and I and my wife to the Theatre, and there saw “The Silent Woman.” The first time that ever I did see it, and it is an excellent play.

1661-01-07 07:00 My Lord Mayor and the whole City had been in arms, above 40,000.

1661-01-07 06:45 News was brought to me that there had been a stir in the City this night by the Fanatiques, who had been up and killed six or seven men.

1661-01-06 17:30 After sermon home, and there I went to my chamber and wrote a letter to send to Mr. Coventry, with a piece of plate along with it.

1661-01-06 15:10 To church again, where, before sermon, a long Psalm was set that lasted an hour, while the sexton gathered his year’s contribucion.

1661-01-06 13:50 My wife and I to church this morning, and so home to dinner to a boiled leg of mutton all alone.

1661-01-05 08:30 By coach home, staying a little in Paul’s Churchyard, to bespeak Ogilby’s Æsop’s Fables and Tully’s Officys to be bound for me.

1661-01-05 10:40 Several people came to me about business, among others the great Tom Fuller, who came to desire a kindness for a friend of his.

1661-01-04 20:40 My father told me how Will and Mary Joyce live a strange life, nothing but fighting, so that her father has a mind to have them divorced.

1661-01-04 17:20 After dinner Mr. Moore and I to the Theatre, where was “The Scornful Lady,” acted very well, it being the first play that ever he saw.

1661-01-04 08:25 I chose a gilt tankard, weighing 31 ounces and a half, and my Lord is allowed 30; so I paid 12s. for the ounce and half over.

1661-01-04 08:10 At the Jewell Office, to choose a piece of gilt plate for my Lord, in return of his offering to the King.

1661-01-03 19:20 To my father’s, where I found my mother gone by Bird, the carrier, to Brampton, upon my uncle’s desire, my aunt being in despair of life.

1661-01-03 17:10 To the Theatre, where was acted “Beggars’ Bush,” it being very well done; and here the first time that ever I saw women come upon the stage.

1661-01-03 08:00 To the Exchequer, where I told over what money I had of my Lord’s and my own there, which I found to be 970l.

1661-01-02 20:50 There stood a man at our door, when I carried the money in, and saw me, which made me a little afeard.

1661-01-02 20:20 To my Lord’s, and took my money I brought ‘thither last night and the silver candlesticks, and left the latter at Alderman Backwell’s.

1661-01-02 18:10 I took a turn in the Hall, and bought the King and Chancellor’s speeches at the dissolving the Parliament last Saturday.

1661-01-02 13:00 I found Pall (my sister) was come; but I do not let her sit down at table with me, which I do at first that she may not expect it hereafter.

1661-01-02 08:50 My Lord to White Hall stairs with much company, and I with him; where we took water for Lambeth, and there he by coach to Portsmouth.

1661-01-02 08:20 Up early, and being called up to my Lord he did give me many commands in his business.

1661-01-01 21:15 Mrs. Pierce is such a slut that I do not love her victualls.

1661-01-01 21:00 To Mr. Pierces, and there supped with them, where we had a calf’s head carboned, but it was raw, we could not eat it, and a good hen.

1661-01-01 16:50 Mr. Moore cast up the fees. One 100l. bag, after I had told it, fell all about the room, and I fear I have lost some of it.

1661-01-01 13:40 Thomas Pepys dinner a sorry, poor dinner for a man of his estate, there being nothing but ordinary meat in it.

1661-01-01 12:30 I carried my wife by coach to my cozen, Thomas Pepys, where we, with my father, Dr. Thomas, cozen Stradwick, Scott, and their wives, dined.

1661-01-01 11:00 I had for them a barrel of oysters, a dish of neat’s tongues, a dish of anchovies, wine of all sorts, and Northdown ale. We were very merry.

1661-01-01 10:30 I take myself now to be worth 300l. clear in money, and all my goods and all manner of debts paid, which are none at all.

1661-01-01 10:18 The Parliament beginning to grow factious, the King did dissolve it December 29th last, and another likely to be chosen speedily.

1661-01-01 10:05 The King settled, and loved of all. The Duke of York matched to my Lord Chancellor’s daughter, which do not please many.

1661-01-01 09:52 Myself in constant good health, and in a most handsome and thriving condition. Blessed be Almighty God for it.

1661-01-01 09:40 After much trouble with workmen I am almost settled; my family being, myself, my wife, Jane, Will. Hewer, and Wayneman, my girle’s brother.

1661-01-01 09:28 At the beginning of this year I do live in one of the houses belonging to the Navy Office, as one of the principal officers.

1661-01-01 08:00 Mr. Moore brought me my last things for me to sign for the last month, and to my great comfort tells me that my fees will come to 80l.
