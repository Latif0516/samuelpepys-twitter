1661-08-07 21:04 To-morrow is a Seal day at the Privy Seal, and it being my month, I am to wait upon my Lord Roberts, Lord Privy Seal, at the Seal.

1661-08-07 17:52 With much ado got to London, where I found all well at home and at my father’s and my Lady’s, but no news yet from my Lord where he is.

1661-08-07 09:30 At Hatfield we walked into the great house; and I would fain have stolen a pretty dog that followed me, but I could not, which troubled me.

1661-08-07 04:02 Called up at three o’clock, and was a-horseback by four.

1661-08-06 21:04 I went to see the church, but I find that both here, and every where else, the Quakers do still continue, and rather grow than lessen.

1661-08-06 20:30 The landlady being a pretty woman, but I durst not take notice of her, her husband being there.

1661-08-06 20:25 Took horse for London, and with much ado, the ways being very bad, got to Baldwick, and there lay and had a good supper by myself.

1661-08-05 22:53 Back again to Brampton and after supper to bed, being now very quiet in the house, which is a content to us.

1661-08-05 18:53 To Graveley, and there at an alehouse met with Chandler and Jackson with whom I had a great deal of discourse, much to my satisfaction.

1661-08-05 14:24 Rode to Yelling, to my cozen Nightingale’s, who hath a pretty house here, and did learn of her all she could tell me concerning my business.

1661-08-05 11:42 To Brampton, and there found my father well, and my aunt gone from the house, which I am glad of, though it costs us a great deal of money.

1661-08-05 08:06 At Stanton borrowed a coat of a man for 6d, and so he rode all the way, poor man, without any.

1661-08-05 08:04 Early to Huntingdon, but was fain to stay a great while at Stanton because of the rain.

1661-08-04 19:32 The young men in Parliament are the most prophane swearing fellows that ever Roger Pepys heard in his life.

1661-08-04 19:27 Roger Pepys told me how basely things have been carried in Parliament by the young men, that did oppose all things moved by serious men.

1661-08-04 11:38 To church, and had a good sermon, and my uncle Talbot went with us and at our coming in the country-people all rose with so much reverence.

1661-08-04 08:42 Discoursed about my uncle’s will. Roger Pepys tells me I shall meet with a great deal of trouble in it. However, he told me what to do.

1661-08-04 07:50 Got up, and by and by walked into the orchard with my cozen Roger, and there plucked some fruit.

1661-08-03 22:57 I rode with Roger Pepys and his two brothers to Impington, and there with great respect was led up by them to the best chamber in the house.

1661-08-03 21:25 They tell me how high the old doctors are in the University over those they found there; for which I am very sorry.

1661-08-03 21:15 I went to the Rose, and there with Mr. Pechell, Sanchy, and others, sat and drank till night and were very merry.

1661-08-03 12:40 I went to the Castle Hill, where the judges were at the Assizes; and I staid till Roger Pepys rose and went with him.

1661-08-03 12:02 I met with a letter-carrier of Cambridge, with whom I rode all the way to Cambridge, my horse being tired, and myself very wet with rain.

1661-08-02 20:04 I rode to Ware, having much discourse with a fellmonger, a Quaker, who told me what a wicked man he had been till within this two years.

1661-08-02 14:57 After dinner my brother Tom came to me and then I made myself ready to get a-horseback for Cambridge.

1661-08-01 14:42 I hear how nurse’s husband has spoken of my Lady Batten how she was such a man’s whore and indeed I do believe that the story is true.

1661-08-01 13:53 We had a venison pasty, brought hot from London, and were very merry.

1661-08-01 10:32 Sir Williams both, and my wife and I and Mrs. Margarett Pen went by coach to Walthamstow, a-gossiping to Mrs. Browne.
