1661-08-23 17:49 I took my wife to the Opera, and shewed her “The Witts,” which I had seen already twice, and was most highly pleased with it.

1661-08-23 11:29 T. Trice took my father and me to one of the judges, and there we were sworn, and so back again to the alehouse and drank and parted.

1661-08-23 10:38 To Tom Trice’s to an alehouse near, and there sat and talked, and finding him fair we examined my uncle’s will before him and Dr. Williams.

1661-08-23 09:27 I found my father and my mother in a discontent, which troubles me much, and indeed she is become very simple and unquiet.

1661-08-22 19:08 With my aunt Wight, my wife, and Pall and I to her house by coach, and there staid and supped upon a Westphalia ham.

1661-08-22 13:12 My uncle Fenner’s house so hot, that my uncle Wight, my father and I were fain to go out, and stay at an alehouse awhile to cool ourselves.

1661-08-22 12:43 Took my wife by coach to my uncle Fenner’s, where there was great deal of company, but poor entertainment, which I wonder at.

1661-08-21 15:48 The girl is very well favoured, and a very child, but modest, and one I think will do very well for my brother.

1661-08-21 15:35 Mrs. Whately only is afeard that her daughter is too young and portion not big enough, but offers 200l. down with her.

1661-08-21 15:32 To Mrs. Whately’s again, and there were well received, and she desirous to have the thing go forward.

1661-08-21 14:14 I understand by Mr. Moore that my Lady Sandwich is brought to bed yesterday of a young Lady, and is very well.

1661-08-21 10:32 With Mrs. Terry we discoursed about and agreed to go to her mother this afternoon to speak with her.

1661-08-21 10:06 To Mrs. Terry, a daughter of Mr. Whately’s, who lately offered a proposal of her sister for a wife for my brother Tom.

1661-08-20 17:04 At the office in the morning and all the afternoon at home to put my papers in order.

1661-08-20 11:41 We come to some agreement with Sir R. Ford for his house to be added to the office to enlarge our quarters.

1661-08-19 21:30 This day my aunt Fenner dyed.

1661-08-19 19:52 My Lady do keep the children at home, and lets them not come any more hither at present, which a little troubles me to lose their company.

1661-08-19 19:39 So homewards, but when we came to look for our coach we found it gone, so we were fain to walk home afoot and saved our money.

1661-08-19 17:55 I hired a coach and went to Chelsy, and there at an alehouse sat and drank and past the time till my Lord Privy Seal came to his house.

1661-08-19 14:58 In comes the King in a plain common riding-suit and velvet cap, in which he seemed a very ordinary man to one that had not known him.

1661-08-19 14:30 I found a thing of my Lord Chancellor’s to be sealed, and so I am forced to go to Worcester House, where severall Lords are met in Council.

1661-08-19 12:04 The children are sent for by their mother my Lady Sandwich to dinner, and my wife goes along with them by coach.

1661-08-18 21:37 Fell to read in “Hooker’s Ecclesiastical Polity,” which Mr. Moore did give me; which I shall read with great pains and love for his sake.

1661-08-18 18:48 To walk in St. James’s Park, and saw great variety of fowl which I never saw before and so home.

1661-08-18 15:05 I took my wife and Mr. Sidney to my Lady to see my Lord Hinchingbroke, who is now well again, and sits up and walks about his chamber.

1661-08-17 19:29 Troubled in mind that I cannot bring myself to mind my business, but to be so much in love of plays.

1661-08-17 16:54 Captain Ferrers and I to the Opera, and saw “The Witts”, which I like exceedingly. The Queen of Bohemia was here, brought by my Lord Craven.

1661-08-17 11:05 I walked with Ned Pickering into St. James’s Park (where I had not been a great while), and there found great and very noble alterations.

1661-08-16 22:52 I understand my Aunt Fenner is upon the point of death.

1661-08-16 11:46 Among others, the famous Tom Fuller is dead of it; and Dr. Nichols, Dean of Paul’s; and my Lord General Monk is very dangerously ill.

1661-08-16 11:44 It is such a sickly time both in City and country (of a sort of fever), that never was heard of almost, unless it was in a plague-time.

1661-08-16 10:32 All our clerks are gone to the buriall of Tom Whitton, a very ingenious, and a likely young man to live, as any in the Office.

1661-08-15 21:55 I followed Sir W. Pen to the Dolphin, and there we sat awhile, and so home after we had made shift to fuddle Mr. Falconer of Woolwich.

1661-08-15 17:01 “The Witts” is a most excellent play, and admirable scenes.

1661-08-15 14:50 To the Opera, which begins again to-day with “The Witts,” never acted yet with scenes; and the King and Duke and Duchess were there.

1661-08-15 13:00 I told my Lady of my Lord’s sickness (of which though it hath been the town-talk, she had heard nothing) and recovery of which she was glad.

1661-08-14 21:10 A letter from Mr Creed that tells me that my Lord is rid of his pain (which was wind got into the muscles of his right side) and his feaver.

1661-08-14 13:45 I went to my Lady’s and dined with her, and found my Lord Hinchingbroke somewhat better.

1661-08-14 10:30 Sir W. Batten and Sir W. Pen and I waited upon the Duke of York, to give him an account of the condition of the Navy for lack of money.

1661-08-13 21:22 I home, and there found my Lady’s three sons come, of which I am glad that I am in condition to do her and my Lord any service in this kind.

1661-08-13 15:15 We had like to have come to some high words between my mother and me, who is become a very simple woman.

1661-08-13 15:09 Pall being there I spoke to my father about my intention not to keep her longer for such and such reasons, which troubled him and me also.

1661-08-13 14:49 I went to my father’s, where I found him within, and went up to him, and there found him settling his papers against his removal.

1661-08-13 13:27 My Lady intends to send her other three sons, Sidney, Oliver, and John, to my house, for fear of the small-pox.

1661-08-13 13:04 To the Wardrobe to dinner, where I met my wife, and found my young Lord very ill.

1661-08-12 18:25 My heart full of trouble for my Lord Sandwich’s sickness, whom we are now confirmed is sick ashore at Alicante.

1661-08-12 16:40 I went to my Lord Hinchingbroke and there found him very ill, and in great fear of the smallpox.

1661-08-12 15:21 I had notice that my Lord Hinchingbroke is fallen ill, which I fear is with the fruit that I did give them at my house.

1661-08-11 18:33 I met with Ned Pickering, who told me what a great match of hunting of a stagg the King had yesterday.

1661-08-11 15:05 To Clerkenwell Church, only to see the two fayre Botelers. I had my full view of them both, but I am out of conceit now with them.

1661-08-10 17:36 To the Theatre, and saw “The merry Devill of Edmunton,” which is a very merry play, the first time I ever saw it, which pleased me well.

1661-08-10 10:52 My father and I did agree with my uncle Wight to meet with my uncle Thomas and read over the Captain’s will for their satisfaction.

1661-08-10 09:42 Came the maid that my wife hath hired for a chamber maid. She is very ugly, so that I cannot care for her, but otherwise seems very good.

1661-08-09 22:20 So to bed.

1661-08-09 21:39 I hear by my wife that Mrs. Hater is not yet delivered, but continues in her pains.

1661-08-09 20:45 I took coach to my father’s, where I found him come home this day from Brampton (as I expected) very well.

1661-08-09 18:19 Mons. Eschar and I took some wine and went to la belle Pierce, who we find big with child, and a pretty lady, one Mrs. Clifford, with her.

1661-08-09 17:03 My Lord Privy Seal caused Mr. Moore to read over the bills, and all ended well. So that I see the Lyon is not so fierce as he is painted.

1661-08-09 16:16 I to White Hall, where comes my Lord Privy Seal, and so we went up to his chamber over the gate at White Hall.

1661-08-09 13:47 News is brought by Mr. Hater that his wife is now falling into labour, so he is come for my wife, who presently went with him.

1661-08-09 09:58 I did promise to be a friend to the son-in-law’s family if he should die, which was all he desired of me, but I do believe he will recover.

1661-08-09 09:21 Word is brought me by a son-in-law of Mr. Pierces that his father is a dying and that he desires that I would come to him before he dies.

1661-08-08 21:38 Discoursing of musique Mons. Eschar spoke so much against the English and in praise of the French that made Mr Mage mad and so he went away.

1661-08-08 20:05 I took Mons. Eschar and Mr. Moore and Dr. Pierce’s brother (the souldier) to the tavern next the Savoy, and there staid and drank with them.

1661-08-08 17:10 To the Privy Seal; but my Lord comes not, which made me mad and gives all the world reason to talk of his delaying of business.

1661-08-07 21:04 To-morrow is a Seal day at the Privy Seal, and it being my month, I am to wait upon my Lord Roberts, Lord Privy Seal, at the Seal.

1661-08-07 17:52 With much ado got to London, where I found all well at home and at my father’s and my Lady’s, but no news yet from my Lord where he is.

1661-08-07 09:30 At Hatfield we walked into the great house; and I would fain have stolen a pretty dog that followed me, but I could not, which troubled me.

1661-08-07 04:02 Called up at three o’clock, and was a-horseback by four.

1661-08-06 21:04 I went to see the church, but I find that both here, and every where else, the Quakers do still continue, and rather grow than lessen.

1661-08-06 20:30 The landlady being a pretty woman, but I durst not take notice of her, her husband being there.

1661-08-06 20:25 Took horse for London, and with much ado, the ways being very bad, got to Baldwick, and there lay and had a good supper by myself.

1661-08-06 13:40 Tom Trice and I to Brampton, where I home to my father who could discern that I had been drinking, which he did never see or hear of before.

1661-08-06 12:03 Took horse and rode to Huntingdon, where I staid with Thos. Trice and Mr. Philips drinking.

1661-08-05 22:53 Back again to Brampton and after supper to bed, being now very quiet in the house, which is a content to us.

1661-08-05 18:53 To Graveley, and there at an alehouse met with Chandler and Jackson with whom I had a great deal of discourse, much to my satisfaction.

1661-08-05 14:24 Rode to Yelling, to my cozen Nightingale’s, who hath a pretty house here, and did learn of her all she could tell me concerning my business.

1661-08-05 11:42 To Brampton, and there found my father well, and my aunt gone from the house, which I am glad of, though it costs us a great deal of money.

1661-08-05 08:06 At Stanton borrowed a coat of a man for 6d, and so he rode all the way, poor man, without any.

1661-08-05 08:04 Early to Huntingdon, but was fain to stay a great while at Stanton because of the rain.

1661-08-04 19:32 The young men in Parliament are the most prophane swearing fellows that ever Roger Pepys heard in his life.

1661-08-04 19:27 Roger Pepys told me how basely things have been carried in Parliament by the young men, that did oppose all things moved by serious men.

1661-08-04 11:38 To church, and had a good sermon, and my uncle Talbot went with us and at our coming in the country-people all rose with so much reverence.

1661-08-04 08:42 Discoursed about my uncle’s will. Roger Pepys tells me I shall meet with a great deal of trouble in it. However, he told me what to do.

1661-08-04 07:50 Got up, and by and by walked into the orchard with my cozen Roger, and there plucked some fruit.

1661-08-03 22:57 I rode with Roger Pepys and his two brothers to Impington, and there with great respect was led up by them to the best chamber in the house.

1661-08-03 21:25 They tell me how high the old doctors are in the University over those they found there; for which I am very sorry.

1661-08-03 21:15 I went to the Rose, and there with Mr. Pechell, Sanchy, and others, sat and drank till night and were very merry.

1661-08-03 12:40 I went to the Castle Hill, where the judges were at the Assizes; and I staid till Roger Pepys rose and went with him.

1661-08-03 12:02 I met with a letter-carrier of Cambridge, with whom I rode all the way to Cambridge, my horse being tired, and myself very wet with rain.

1661-08-03 09:10 I got up early the next morning and got to Barkway, where I staid and drank.

1661-08-02 20:04 I rode to Ware, having much discourse with a fellmonger, a Quaker, who told me what a wicked man he had been till within this two years.

1661-08-02 14:57 After dinner my brother Tom came to me and then I made myself ready to get a-horseback for Cambridge.

1661-08-01 14:42 I hear how nurse’s husband has spoken of my Lady Batten how she was such a man’s whore and indeed I do believe that the story is true.

1661-08-01 13:53 We had a venison pasty, brought hot from London, and were very merry.

1661-08-01 10:32 Sir Williams both, and my wife and I and Mrs. Margarett Pen went by coach to Walthamstow, a-gossiping to Mrs. Browne.
