1661-06-07 22:32 After dinner to the office, and there till late at night.

1661-06-06 18:58 Here came two gentlewomen, and one could play pretty well upon the viallin, but, good God! how these ignorant people did cry her up for it!

1661-06-06 17:38 The Captain and I again to Bridewell to Mr. Holland’s, where his wife also, a plain dowdy, and his mother was.

1661-06-06 14:10 We heard musique at the Globe, and saw the simple motion that is there of a woman with a rod in her hand keeping time to the musique.

1661-06-06 12:07 My head hath aked all night, and all this morning, with my last night’s debauch.

1661-06-06 10:55 Lieutenant Lambert and I went down by water to Greenwich, in our way observing and discoursing upon the things of a ship.

1661-06-06 00:14 And so to bed, very near fuddled.

1661-06-06 00:03 Sir W. Pen came out in his shirt, and there we staid talking and singing, and drinking claret, and eating botargo and bread and butter.

1661-06-05 20:23 It being very hot weather I took my flageolette and played upon the leads in the garden.

1661-06-05 16:19 Sir W. Pen and I went home with Sir R. Slingsby to bowls in his ally, and there had good sport.

1661-06-05 09:49 I did give my wife 4l. to lay out upon lace and other things for herself.

1661-06-04 17:32 To the Theatre and saw “Harry the 4th,” a good play.

1661-06-04 13:52 Very good discourse about having of young noblemen and gentlemen to think of going to sea, as being as honourable service as the land war.

1661-06-04 10:30 The houses did not like us, and so that design at present is stopped.

1661-06-04 10:11 The Comptroller came to see a house or two near our office, then he would have me have Mr Turner’s lodgings and himself mine and Mr Davis’s.

1661-06-03 18:31 Mr. Creed and I, with much pleasure, walked quite round the Towre, which I never did before.

1661-06-03 09:44 Discoursing with my Lord, he did instruct me as to the business of the Wardrobe, in case, in his absence, Mr. Townsend should die.

1661-06-02 16:24 It rained hard, as it hath done of late so much that we begin to doubt a famine, and so Greatorex was forced to stay longer than I desired.

1661-06-02 15:05 Greatorext showed me the strength that levers have, and that what is got as to matter of strength is lost by them as to matter of time.

1661-06-02 13:30 Going home I found Greatorex come to see me, and so he and I in my chamber drinking of wine and eating of anchovies an hour or two.

1661-06-01 22:10 Having wrote letters into the country and read some things I went to bed.

1661-06-01 16:46 To Redriffe, calling at the half-way house, and come into a room where there was infinite of new cakes placed, and there we were very merry.

1661-06-01 10:34 By water to Woolwich, and there went from ship to ship to give order for and take notice of their forwardness to go forth.
