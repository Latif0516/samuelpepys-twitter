1661-06-15 13:53 I went and dined with my Lady, who, now my Lord is gone, is come to her poor housekeeping again.

1661-06-14 16:42 I went home by coach to bed, and went not to the office at all, and by keeping myself warm, I broke wind and so came to some ease.

1661-06-14 15:18 But I could not stay with my father myself, for having got a great cold by my playing the fool in the water yesterday I was in great pain.

1661-06-14 15:14 To my father’s, and did give him order about the buying of this cloth to send to my Lord.

1661-06-13 22:14 I fell asleep till I came almost to the Tower, and there the Captain and I parted, and I home and with wine enough in my head, went to bed.

1661-06-13 21:32 Young Poole took us on board the Charity and gave us wine there, with which I had full enough, and so to our wherry again.

1661-06-13 20:12 We parted hence and went home with Mr. Falconer, who did give us cherrys and good wine.

1661-06-13 19:21 At Woolwich went on shore and so to the tavern where we drank a great deal both wine and beer.

1661-06-13 18:02 We toward London in our boat. Pulled off our stockings and bathed our legs a while in the river, which I had not done some years before.

1661-06-13 17:13 So with a sad and merry heart I left them sailing pleasantly from Erith, hoping to be in the Downs tomorrow early.

1661-06-13 16:52 My Lord did give five guns, all they had charged, which was the greatest respect my Lord could do me, and of which I was not a little proud.

1661-06-13 16:24 I took leave of W. Howe, and the rest of my friends, then took leave of my Lord, who give me his hand and parted with great respect.

1661-06-13 11:42 I went down with my Lord in the barge to Deptford, and there went on board the Dutch yacht and staid there a good while.

1661-06-13 10:21 My Lord takes barge, and was met by Sir R. Slingsby, who took his leave of my Lord, and I heard my Lord thank him for his kindness to me.

1661-06-13 07:12 I put on my gray cloth suit and faced white coat, made of one of my wife’s pettycoates, the first time I have had it on.

1661-06-12 19:13 To White Hall, where I met my Lord, who told me he must have 300l. laid out in cloth, to give in Barbary, as presents among the Turks.

1661-06-12 17:22 At home all day with my workmen, and doing several things, among others writing the letter resolved of yesterday to the Duke.

1661-06-12 09:41 To Lambeth to drink our morning draft, where at the Three Mariners, a place noted for their ale, we staid awhile very merry, and so away.

1661-06-12 07:10 A day kept between a fast and a feast, the Bishops not being ready enough to keep the fast for foul weather before fair weather came.

1661-06-11 11:23 Sir G. Carteret with us; we agreed upon a letter to the Duke of York, to tell him the sad condition of this office for want of money.

1661-06-10 22:14 We lay in Sir R. Slingsby’s lodgings in the dining room there in one green bed, my house being now in its last work of painting and whiting.

1661-06-10 13:43 I dined with my Lady; but after we were set, comes in some persons of condition, and so the children and I rose and dined by ourselves.

1661-06-10 08:41 My Lord tells me that he do intrust me with the seeing of all things done in his absence as to this great preparation.

1661-06-10 08:22 My Lord is to go to Algier to settle the business; and so to come back to Lisbone, and there to meet the fleet that is to follow him.

1661-06-10 08:20 To my Lord’s, who privately told me how the King had made him Embassador in the bringing over the Queen.

1661-06-09 14:11 My wife and I walked to my Lady’s at the Wardrobe, and there dined and was exceeding much made of.

1661-06-09 08:41 My wife put on her black silk gown, which is now laced all over with black gimp lace, as the fashion is, in which she is very pretty.

1661-06-08 20:10 Mr. Creed and I went to the tobacco shop under Temple Bar gate, and went to the top of the house and sat drinking Lambeth ale a good while.

1661-06-08 17:35 I saw Bartholomew Faire, the first time it was acted now a-days. A most admirable play and well acted, but too much prophane and abusive.

1661-06-08 10:13 My Lord did tell me that he would have me go to Mr. Townsend, whom he had ordered to discover to me the whole mystery of the Wardrobe.

1661-06-07 22:32 After dinner to the office, and there till late at night.

1661-06-06 18:58 Here came two gentlewomen, and one could play pretty well upon the viallin, but, good God! how these ignorant people did cry her up for it!

1661-06-06 17:38 The Captain and I again to Bridewell to Mr. Holland’s, where his wife also, a plain dowdy, and his mother was.

1661-06-06 14:10 We heard musique at the Globe, and saw the simple motion that is there of a woman with a rod in her hand keeping time to the musique.

1661-06-06 12:07 My head hath aked all night, and all this morning, with my last night’s debauch.

1661-06-06 10:55 Lieutenant Lambert and I went down by water to Greenwich, in our way observing and discoursing upon the things of a ship.

1661-06-06 00:14 And so to bed, very near fuddled.

1661-06-06 00:03 Sir W. Pen came out in his shirt, and there we staid talking and singing, and drinking claret, and eating botargo and bread and butter.

1661-06-05 20:23 It being very hot weather I took my flageolette and played upon the leads in the garden.

1661-06-05 16:19 Sir W. Pen and I went home with Sir R. Slingsby to bowls in his ally, and there had good sport.

1661-06-05 09:49 I did give my wife 4l. to lay out upon lace and other things for herself.

1661-06-04 17:32 To the Theatre and saw “Harry the 4th,” a good play.

1661-06-04 13:52 Very good discourse about having of young noblemen and gentlemen to think of going to sea, as being as honourable service as the land war.

1661-06-04 10:30 The houses did not like us, and so that design at present is stopped.

1661-06-04 10:11 The Comptroller came to see a house or two near our office, then he would have me have Mr Turner’s lodgings and himself mine and Mr Davis’s.

1661-06-03 18:31 Mr. Creed and I, with much pleasure, walked quite round the Towre, which I never did before.

1661-06-03 09:44 Discoursing with my Lord, he did instruct me as to the business of the Wardrobe, in case, in his absence, Mr. Townsend should die.

1661-06-02 16:24 It rained hard, as it hath done of late so much that we begin to doubt a famine, and so Greatorex was forced to stay longer than I desired.

1661-06-02 15:05 Greatorext showed me the strength that levers have, and that what is got as to matter of strength is lost by them as to matter of time.

1661-06-02 13:30 Going home I found Greatorex come to see me, and so he and I in my chamber drinking of wine and eating of anchovies an hour or two.

1661-06-01 22:10 Having wrote letters into the country and read some things I went to bed.

1661-06-01 16:46 To Redriffe, calling at the half-way house, and come into a room where there was infinite of new cakes placed, and there we were very merry.

1661-06-01 10:34 By water to Woolwich, and there went from ship to ship to give order for and take notice of their forwardness to go forth.
