1660-01-03 07:30 My wife had a very bad night of it through wind and cold.

1660-01-02 21:50 Having not eaten anything but bread and cheese, my wife cut me a slice of brawn which I received from my Lady; as good as ever I had any.

1660-01-02 21:10 I went home, and finding my wife gone to see Mrs. Hunt, I went to Will’s, and there sat with Mr. Ashwell talking and singing, and so home.

1660-01-02 13:15 Mr. Moore and I and another gentleman went out and drank a cup of ale in the new market, and I eat some bread and cheese for my dinner.

1660-01-02 11:20 Great talk that many places have declared for a free Parliament; it is believed they will be forced to fill up the House with old members. 

1660-01-02 10:30 The House was to-day upon finishing the act for the Council of State, which they did; and were to sit again thereupon in the afternoon.

1660-01-02 09:25 I went to Mr. Crew’s and borrowed 10l. of Mr. Andrewes for my own use, and so went to my office, where there was nothing to do. 

1660-01-02 08:45 I went to Mr. Sheply who was drawing of sack in the cellar, and told me that my Lord had given him order to give me the dozen of bottles. 

1660-01-02 08:05 Before I went forth old East brought me a dozen of bottles of sack, and I gave him a shilling for his pains.

1660-01-01 19:30 Went with my wife to my father’s, and in going observed the great posts which the City have set up at the Conduit in Fleet-street.

1660-01-01 17:10 I staid at home all the afternoon, looking over my accounts.

1660-01-01 14:20 Dined at home in the garret, where my wife dressed the remains of a turkey, and in the doing of it she burned her hand.

1660-01-01 12:00 Went to Mr. Gunning’s chapel, where he made a very good sermon: “That in the fulness of time God sent his Son, made of a woman,” &c.

1660-01-01 10:28 My own private condition very handsome, and esteemed rich, but indeed very poor; besides my office, which at present is somewhat uncertain.

1660-01-01 10:17 The new Common Council of the City sent to Monk their sword-bearer, to acquaint him with their desires for a free and full Parliament.

1660-01-01 10:06 Blessed be God, at the end of the last year I was in very good health, without any sense of my old pain, but upon taking of cold.

1660-01-01 08:25 I rose, put on my suit with great skirts, having not lately worn any other clothes but them.
