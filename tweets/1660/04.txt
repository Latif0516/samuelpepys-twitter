1660-04-07 12:00 My Lord sent for me down to eat some oysters, the best my Lord said that ever he ate in his life, though I have ate as good at Bardsey.

1660-04-07 09:10 The wind grew high, and we being among the sands lay at anchor; I began to be dizzy and squeamish.

1660-04-06 21:50 It being fine moonshine, I staid late walking upon the quarter-deck with Mr. Cuttance, learning of some sea terms.

1660-04-02 11:15 Comes Mr. Ed. Pickering, like a coxcomb. He tells me that the King will come in, but that Monk did resolve to have the doing of it himself.

1660-04-02 08:45 Mr. Creed was troubled to hear that he could not go along with my Lord, for he had already got his things thither, thinking to stay there.
