1663-10-16 17:48 I went to the Tangier Committee, where very good discourse concerning the Articles of peace to be continued with Guyland.

1663-10-16 14:34 Up to remove my chest and clothes up stairs to my new wardrobe, that I may have all my things above where I lie.

1663-10-15 06:32 Going to enjoy my wife this morning, I had a great pain in the end of my yard when my yard was stiff, as if I strained some nerve or vein.

1663-10-15 05:03 Up, I bless God being now in pretty good condition, but cannot come to make natural stools yet.

1663-10-14 21:32 With Sir W Pen, speaking against Sir W Batten and Sir J Minnes, but no more than the folly of one and the knavery of the other do deserve.

1663-10-14 15:22 Lord! to see the laughing, sporting, and no attention, but confusion in their service, more like brutes than people knowing the true God.

1663-10-14 15:07 In the end they had a prayer for the King, which they pronounced his name in Portugall; but the prayer, like the rest, in Hebrew.

1663-10-14 14:42 Their Laws that they take out of the press are carried by several men, four or five several burthens in all, and they relieve one another.

1663-10-14 14:30 At the putting on their vayles they do say something, to which others that hear him do cry Amen, and the party do kiss his vayle.

1663-10-14 14:20 To the Jewish Synagogue: where the men and boys in their vayles, and the women behind a lattice out of sight.

1663-10-14 10:07 Sir J. Minnes reading the Anatomy of the body to me, but so sillily as to the making of me understand any thing that I was weary of him.

1663-10-13 22:06 To supper and to bed, being mightily pleased with all my house and my red chamber, where my wife and I intend constantly to lie.

1663-10-13 20:32 My Lady Castlemaine, I hear, is in as great favour as ever, and the King supped with her the very first night he came from Bath.

1663-10-13 19:49 Home, with some ease and pleasure that I hope to be able to follow my business again, which I am resolved to return to with more eagerness.

1663-10-13 14:15 John Cole, my old friend, came to see and speak with me about a friend. I find him ingenious, but more and more discern his city pedantry.

1663-10-13 05:30 I had about two stools in the night – and pissed well. Voided some wind.

1663-10-12 21:25 The clyster began with my walking to work, and gave me three or four most excellent stools and carried away wind.

1663-10-12 21:07 My wife did give me a clyster which Mr. Hollyard directed, a pint of ale, 4 oz of sugar, and 2 oz of butter. I lay upon the bed an hour.

1663-10-12 16:47 When I went to try to shit, the little straining which I thought was no strain at all did by and by bring me some pain for a good while.

1663-10-12 11:30 Whether it be the jogging, or by having my mind more employed I know not, but I do now piss with much less pain.

1663-10-12 10:05 The Duke wished we all had made more profit than he had of our places, and that we had got as much as one man below stayres in the Court.

1663-10-12 08:15 Being forced to go to the Duke at St. James’s, I took coach and in my way called upon Mr. Hollyard and had his advice to take a glyster.

1663-10-11 22:03 After supper to bed as I use to be, in pain, without breaking wind and shitting.

1663-10-11 20:15 Altering chairs in my chamber and set them above in the red room, and so put their green covers upon those that were above, not so handsome.

1663-10-11 18:25 The greatest of my pain I find to come by my straining to get something out backwards, which strains my yard and cods.

1663-10-11 18:20 I finding myself neither to fart nor go to stool after one stool in the morning, the effect of my electuary last night.

1663-10-11 08:57 My wife forebore to make herself clean to-day, but continued in a sluttish condition till to-morrow.

1663-10-10 22:15 Mr. Hollyard sends me an electuary to take (a walnut quantity of it) going to bed, which I did.

1663-10-10 12:58 Dined at home, my wife and house in the dirtiest pickle that ever she and it was in, but in order, I hope, this night to be very clean.

1663-10-10 11:34 I had a couple of stools forced after the juniper water, and did break a fart or two, but whether I shall grow better upon it I cannot tell.

1663-10-10 08:01 Sir J. Minnes and Sir W. Batten did advise me to take some juniper water, and Sir W. Batten sent for some, strong water made of juniper.

1663-10-09 17:12 I did drink one of the bottles, but it was a most loathsome draught, and had a stool or two, but in no plenty, nor any wind almost.

1663-10-09 15:44 My wife’s closet indeed is, and will be, a very pleasant place, and is at present very pretty, and such as she will find great content in.

1663-10-09 13:30 Mr. Hollyard sent me two bottles of drink and some syrup, one bottle to take now and the other to-morrow morning.

1663-10-09 12:10 I sent word to Mr. Hollyard of my condition, that I could neither have a natural stool nor break wind, and by that means still in pain.

1663-10-09 11:22 I did keep my bed most of this morning, my body I find being still bound and little wind, and so my pain returned again, though not so bad.

1663-10-08 23:03 I took some powder that Mr. Holliard did give me in white wine, and sat late up, with my wife in my chamber till it had done working.

1663-10-08 14:24 Mr. Holliard assuring me that it is only my constitution being costive, and that, and cold from without, breeding and keeping the wind.

1663-10-08 12:07 Home to dinner, my pain coming again by breaking no wind nor having any stool.

1663-10-08 04:48 Pissed pretty well, but no more wind came as it used to do plentifully, after it once begun, nor any inclination to stool.

1663-10-07 21:38 Having a good fire in my chamber, I begun to break six or seven small and great farts; and so to bed and lay in good ease.

1663-10-07 18:32 I kept within all day in great pain, and could break no wind nor have any stool after my physic had done working.

1663-10-06 22:20 Finding myself beginning to be troubled with wind, and in pain in making water, I took a couple of pills that I had by me of Mr. Hollyard’s.

1663-10-06 10:03 Mr. Chr. Pett and Deane were summoned to give an account of some knees which Pett reported bad, that were to be served in by Sir W. Warren.

1663-10-06 04:07 My wife waked to ring the bell to call up our mayds, and I was angry that our bell did not wake them sooner, but I will get a bigger bell.

1663-10-05 21:47 I sat with Sir W. Penn, talking very largely of Sir J. Minnes’s simplicity and unsteadiness, and of Sir W. Batten’s suspicious dealings.

1663-10-05 17:58 My wife all day putting up her hangings in her closett, which she do very prettily herself with her own hand, to my great content.

1663-10-04 21:07 All the evening most pleasantly passed the time in good discourse of our fortune and family till supper.

1663-10-04 09:57 Up and to church, my house being miserably overflooded with rayne last night, which makes me almost mad.

1663-10-03 17:22 Mr. Blackburne came to know the reason of his kinsman (my Will) being observed by his friends of late to droop much.

1663-10-03 13:42 Home to dinner, and then abroad to buy a bell to hang by our chamber door to call the mayds.

1663-10-03 12:06 To the office, and there we sat full of business all the morning.

1663-10-03 05:59 Up, being well pleased with my new lodging and the convenience of having our mayds and none else about us, Will lying below.

1663-10-02 22:12 To supper and to bed, up to our red chamber, where we purpose always to lie.

1663-10-02 16:55 I received a letter from Mr. Barlow, with a Terella, which I had hoped he had sent me, but I find it is to present to my Lord Sandwich.

1663-10-02 13:06 Home to dinner with my wife, who is over head and eares in getting her house up.

1663-10-02 09:54 Mr Cutler do assure me that there is likelyhood of a war with Holland but I hope we shall be in good condition before it comes to break out.

1663-10-02 07:49 Visited Mr. Coventry as a compliment after his new coming to town, but had no great talk with him, he being full of business.

1663-10-01 22:05 This day the King and Court returned from their progress.

1663-10-01 21:55 Home to see the painter at work in my wife’s closet, and so to bed, having been merry with the painter, late, while he was doing his work.

1663-10-01 16:10 I by water to Deptford about a little business, and so back again, buying a couple of good eeles by the way.
