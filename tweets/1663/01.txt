1663-01-17 19:20 I found my wife and her brother discoursing about Mr Ashwell’s daughter whom we are like to have for my wife’s woman. I hope it may do well.

1663-01-17 17:40 We did see “The Five Hours” entertainment, which is a fine play, though, through my being out of order, it did not seem so good as at first.

1663-01-17 05:48 Troubled about law matters, it came into my mind that of Epictetus, which did put me to a deal of ease, it being a saying of great reason.

1663-01-16 13:30 Captain Brewer, the paynter, tells me how highly the Presbyters do talk in the coffeehouses still, which I wonder at.

1663-01-16 07:07 Much troubled in mind this night in my dreams about my uncle Thomas and his son going to law with us.

1663-01-15 17:39 I vexed, having left my keys in my other pocket in my chamber, and my door is shut, so that I was forced to set my boy in at the window.

1663-01-15 16:07 We walked up and down the Yard and Wett Dock and did examine the proof of our new way of the call-books which we think will be of great use.

1663-01-15 13:21 I took Mr. Coventry to dine with me, I having a wild goose roasted, and a cold chine of beef and a barrel of oysters.

1663-01-14 21:57 To the office upon business, and numbering and examining part of my sea-manuscript with great pleasure, my wife sitting working by me.

1663-01-14 13:50 My wife tells me of another woman offered by her brother that is pretty and can sing, to which I do listen but will not appear over forward.

1663-01-14 10:08 Lay very long in bed, till with shame forced to rise, being called up by Mr. Bland about business.

1663-01-13 22:04 To supper, had a good sack posset and cold meat, and sent my guests away, both them and myself pleased with our management of this day.

1663-01-13 15:25 The women to cards in my wife’s chamber, the Dr. and Mr. Pierce in mine, because the dining-room smokes unless I keep a good charcoal fire.

1663-01-13 15:01 My dinner was noble and enough.

1663-01-13 14:55 I had for them, after oysters, a hash of rabbits, a lamb and a chine of beef. Next a dish of roasted fowl, and a tart, and fruit and cheese.

1663-01-13 13:20 I find my new table very proper, and will hold nine or ten people well, but eight with great room.

1663-01-13 12:15 I home, whither by and by comes Dr. Clerke and his lady, his sister, and a she-cozen, and Mr. Pierce and his wife, which was all my guests.

1663-01-13 06:10 My poor wife rose by five o’clock, and went to market and bought fowls and many other things for dinner, with which I was highly pleased.

1663-01-12 22:29 I appeared angry there were no more things got ready against to-morrow’s feast. In that passion sat up long and went discontented to bed.

1663-01-12 21:30 Home, and found my wife’s new gown come home, and she mightily pleased with it.

1663-01-12 20:44 To the Committee, where we attended to Sir J. Lawson’s description of Tangier and the place for the Mole, of which he brought a draught.

1663-01-12 14:33 My boy had struck down Creed’s boy in the dirt, with his new suit on, and the poor boy was in a pitifull taking and pickle.

1663-01-12 09:42 To see Sir J. Lawson, who I found the same plain man that he was, after all his success in the Straights, with which he is come loaded home.

1663-01-11 17:07 To my office all the afternoon writing orders myself to have ready against to-morrow, that I might not appear negligent to Mr. Coventry.

1663-01-10 16:28 Mr. Creed sat with me talking good discourse, as he is full of it, though a cunning knave in his heart, at least not to be too much trusted.

1663-01-09 17:49 I doubt the heartburning will not soon over. I am sorry for the tearing of so many loving letters of mine from sea and elsewhere to her.

1663-01-09 17:42 For my honour I am forced to make my wife a new Moyre gown, which troubles me to part with so much money, but it sets us to friends again.

1663-01-09 12:55 As discontented as I am, I could not forbear smiling all dinner till my wife began to speak bad words again, and then I began to be angry.

1663-01-09 09:00 I took her bundle of papers, and leapt out of the bed, and I tore them all before her face, though it went against my heart to do it.

1663-01-09 08:57 Being so in danger of being met with and read by others, I was vexed at it, and desired her and then commanded her to tear the paper.

1663-01-09 08:55 She now read it, and it was so piquant and wrote in English, and most of it true, of the retiredness of her life, and how unpleasant it was.

1663-01-09 08:52 My wife pulls out a paper, a copy of what, a pretty while since, she had wrote in a discontent to me, which I would not read, but burnt.

1663-01-09 08:12 My wife begun to speak of the necessity of keeping somebody to bear her company; her familiarity with her servants is it that spoils them.

1663-01-08 22:07 Home to supper and to bed, now resolving to set up my rest as to plays till Easter, if not Whitsuntide next, excepting plays at Court.

1663-01-08 17:15 The play, in one word, is the best, for the variety and the most excellent continuance of the plot to the very end, that ever I saw.

1663-01-08 13:55 I made my wife to get ready, though we were forced to send for a smith, to break open her trunk, her mayde being gone forth with the keys.

1663-01-08 13:40 There being the famous new play acted the first time to-day, “The Adventures of Five Hours,” at the Duke’s house, I did long to see it.

1663-01-08 07:30 I sent some wine for my father, to make his feast among his Brampton friends this Christmas, and my muff to my mother, sent as from my wife.

1663-01-07 18:21 My wife tells me she hears that by Sarah’s going to live at Sir W. Pen’s, all our affairs of my family are made known there.

1663-01-07 16:09 I searched the ships in the Wett Dock for fire and found all in good order, it being dangerous for the King that his ships lie together.

1663-01-07 14:42 I viewed old pay-books, and found that the Commanders did never heretofore receive any pay for the rigging time, but only for seatime.

1663-01-06 22:12 Blessing God for his mercy to bring me home, after much pleasure, to my house and business with health and resolution to fall to work again.

1663-01-06 22:07 I do find my mind so apt to run to its old want of pleasures, that it is high time to betake myself to my late vows, which I will to-morrow.

1663-01-06 18:17 Vexed at my wife’s neglect in leaving her scarf and night-dressings in the coach, though, I confess, she did give them to me to look after.

1663-01-06 17:07 To the Duke’s house, and there saw “Twelfth Night” acted well, though it be but a silly play, and not related at all to the name or day.

1663-01-06 10:21 Into Wood Street and bought a fine table for my dining-room; while we were buying it there was a scare-fire in an ally but they quenched it.

1663-01-05 16:47 At the Cockpitt, the Duke and Duchess did show some impertinent and unnatural dalliances, such as kissing, and leaning upon one another.

1663-01-05 11:32 I drank more than I have drunk at one time, or shall again a great while, when I come to return to my oaths, which I intend in a day or two.

1663-01-05 11:28 I took Sir W. Batten and Captain Allen into the wine cellar to my tenant (as I call him), and there drank a great deal of variety of wines.

1663-01-05 08:07 Sir J. Lawson is come home to Portsmouth from the Streights, who is now come with great renown among all men.

1663-01-04 21:55 To Mr. Hunt’s and was most prettily entertained by him and her, who are two as good people as I hardly know any, and so kind one to another.

1663-01-04 17:42 I would not be thought a lazy body by Mr. Coventry and others by being seen, as I have lately been, to walk up and down doing nothing.

1663-01-04 14:09 It being a very great trouble to me that I should have a sister of so ill a nature, that I must be forced to spend money upon a stranger.

1663-01-04 14:08 My wife did propound my having of my sister Pall at my house again to be her woman, since one we must have.

1663-01-04 13:21 Up and to church, where a lazy sermon, and so home to dinner to a good piece of powdered beef, but a little too salt.

1663-01-03 18:22 To my office all the afternoon till night, putting business in order with great content in my mind.

1663-01-02 20:08 I to see Sir W. Pen, who is fallen sick again. I staid a while talking with him, and so to my office, practising some arithmetique.

1663-01-02 15:09 Sir W. Batten was paying off tickets but so simply and arbitrarily, upon a dull pretence of doing right to the King, that I was weary of it.

1663-01-02 12:07 Lay long in bed, and so up and to the office, where all the morning alone doing something or another.

1663-01-01 17:52 We saw “The Villaine” again; and the more I see it, the more I am offended at my first undervaluing the play, it being good and pleasant.

1663-01-01 13:40 I find that there is nothing almost but bawdry at Court from top to bottom. How much of this is true, God knows, but it is common talk.

1663-01-01 13:33 Mrs. Sarah tells us how the King sups at least four times every week with my Lady Castlemaine; and often stays till the morning with her.

1663-01-01 10:40 I spent time walking among the courtiers, which I perceive I shall be able to do with confidence, being now pretty well known among them.

1663-01-01 10:05 Lay with my wife at my Lord’s lodgings, where I have been these two nights, with great pleasure talking, then I rose and to White Hall.
