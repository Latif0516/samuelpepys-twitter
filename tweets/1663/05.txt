1663-05-23 17:03 We saw a draught of the arms of the Barbary company. The motto too tedious: “Regio floret, patrocinio commercium, commercioque Regnum.”

1663-05-23 04:32 Waked by my blackbird, which whistles as well as ever I heard; only it is the beginning of many tunes, but leaves them, and goes no further.

1663-05-22 15:24 By water to Greenwich, we walked pleasantly to Woolwich, in our way hearing the nightingales sing.

1663-05-22 11:55 To my office, and busy all the morning, among other things, learning to understand the course of the tides, and I think I do now do it.

1663-05-22 07:22 Rundall hath sent me a fine blackbird, which I went to see. He tells me he was offered 20s. for him as he came along, he do so whistle.

1663-05-21 20:32 My wife’s mind finds other sweets besides pleasing of me, and so makes her that she begins not to take pleasure in me as heretofore.

1663-05-21 20:30 I fear I shall go near to lose my command over my wife, and nothing do it more than giving her this occasion of dancing and other pleasures.

1663-05-21 13:10 To dinner, my wife and I having high words about her dancing to that degree that I did enter and make a vow to myself not to oppose her.

1663-05-21 06:02 Up, but cannot get up so early as I was wont, nor my mind to business as it should be and used to be before this dancing.

1663-05-20 22:07 Pembleton coming, we danced a country dance or two and so broke up and to bed, my mind restless and like to be so while she learns to dance.

1663-05-20 14:20 I met Pembleton, who has dined with my wife, which she takes no notice of, but whether that proceeds out of fear to displease me I know not.

1663-05-19 20:17 My damned jealousy took fire, Pembleton and my wife being of a side and I seeing of him take her by the hand in play.

1663-05-19 19:44 By water (taking Pembleton with us), over the water to the Halfway House, where we played at ninepins.

1663-05-19 14:29 To the Assay Office and saw the manner of assaying of gold and silver, and how silver melted down with gold do part, which is a miracle.

1663-05-19 10:15 To the Tower; and by Mr. Slingsby, and Mr. Howard, Controller of the Mint, we were shown the method of making this new money.

1663-05-19 05:42 I observe how my dancing and lying a morning or two longer than ordinary for my cold do make me hard to rise as I used to do.

1663-05-18 19:10 To the Park, where we saw many fine faces, and one exceeding handsome, in a white dress over her head, with many others very beautiful.

1663-05-18 17:46 Mrs. Stuart is a fine woman, and they say now a common mistress to the King, as my Lady Castlemaine is; which is a great pity.

1663-05-18 16:06 Lord! in what a poor condition Mrs. Clerke’s best chamber is, and things about her, for all the outside and show that she makes.

1663-05-17 20:30 To bed having another small falling out and myself vexed with my old fit of jealousy about her dancing-master. But I am a fool for doing it.

1663-05-17 12:05 In my chamber all the morning, preparing my great letters to my father, stating to him the perfect condition of our estate.

1663-05-16 15:15 I did go up to them to practise, and did make an end of “La Duchesse,” which I think I should, with a little pains, do very well.

1663-05-16 14:44 Lord! with what jealousy did I walk up and down my chamber listening to hear whether Pembleton and my wife danced or no, which they did.

1663-05-16 06:00 I do not find honesty enough in my own mind but that upon temptation I could be false to her, therefore ought not to expect more from her.

1663-05-16 05:55 Up with my mind disturbed and with my last night’s doubts upon me. For which I deserve to be beaten.

1663-05-15 22:48 I am ashamed to think what a course I did take by lying to see whether my wife did wear drawers to-day as she used to do.

1663-05-15 22:40 Late home again and ready to chide at every thing, and then suddenly to bed and could hardly sleep, yet durst not say any thing.

1663-05-15 20:34 So deadly full of jealousy I am that my heart and head did so cast about and fret that I could not do any business, but went to my office.

1663-05-15 20:30 Home, where I found it almost night, and my wife and the dancing-master alone above, not dancing but talking.

1663-05-15 18:07 The old women had like to have killed, the other day, the Bishop of Galloway, and not half the Churches of the whole kingdom conform.

1663-05-15 16:46 My Lord Hinchingbroke, I am told, hath had a mischance to kill his boy by his birding-piece going off as he was a-fowling.

1663-05-15 15:24 My Lady Castlemaine rules the King who hath all the tricks of Aretin that are practised to give pleasure. In which he is able having a large

1663-05-15 13:10 There was a falling-out two days ago at my Lord of Oxford’s house, where there were high words and blows, and pulling off of perriwiggs.

1663-05-15 07:03 The keeper of the Pell Mell told me of what the earth is mixed that do floor the Mall, that there is cockle-shells powdered to keep it fast.

1663-05-14 14:22 We received a baskett from my sister Pall, made by her of paper, which hath a great deal of labour in it for country innocent work.

1663-05-14 10:10 The King did send for my Lord the other day to my Lady Castlemaine’s, to play at cards, where he lost 50l.; for which I am sorry.

1663-05-14 07:49 Mr. Moore fears the King will be tempted to endeavour the setting the Crown upon the little Duke, which may cause troubles.

1663-05-13 22:06 Home to supper, to cards, and to bed.

1663-05-13 16:45 One-eyed Cooper came to see me and I made him to show me the use of platts, and to understand the lines, and how to find how lands bear, &c.

1663-05-13 14:22 Lord! to see how my wife will not be thought to need telling by me or Ashwell, and yet will plead that she has learnt but a month.

1663-05-12 20:45 To my office, our chief business being the reconciling the business of the pieces of eight mentioned yesterday before the Duke of York.

1663-05-12 12:27 A little angry with my wife for minding nothing now but the dancing-master, having him come twice a day, which is a folly.

1663-05-11 20:04 Mr. Crumlum’s wife is a pretty woman, never yet with child, and methinks looks as if her mouth watered now and then upon some of her boys.

1663-05-11 17:53 The other day Dr. Clerke and Mr. Pierce did dissect two bodies, a man and a woman; before the King, with which the King was highly pleased.

1663-05-11 15:10 A dispute about the pieces of eight rated by Mr Creed at 4s and 5d, and by Pitts at 4s and 9d, which was the greatest husbandry to the King?

1663-05-11 11:34 Home, and both coming and going did con my lesson on my Ruler to measure timber, which I think I can well undertake now to do.

1663-05-11 09:22 Lord, to see in what a maze I was, that, having a sword about me, I never thought of it, but might, for want of courage, have been worried.

1663-05-11 09:20 On foot to Greenwich, where going I was set upon by a great dogg, who got hold of my garters, and might have done me hurt.

1663-05-10 14:52 Among other things, talking of the way of ordinaries, that it is very convenient, because a man knows what he hath to pay.

1663-05-10 13:13 The Bishop of Galloway was besieged in his house by some women, and had like to have been outraged, but I know not how he was secured.

1663-05-10 05:32 Up betimes, and put on a black cloth suit, with white lynings under all, as the fashion is to wear, to appear under the breeches.

1663-05-09 15:10 I did try three borders and perriwiggs, meaning to wear one; yet I have no stomach, but that the pains of keeping my hair clean is so great.

1663-05-08 17:47 I am resolved to deny myself the liberty of two plays at Court, which are in arreare to me for the months of March and April.

1663-05-08 17:45 My oath against going to plays do not oblige me against this house, because it was not then in being.

1663-05-08 17:24 Shamed that my wife and woman were in such a pickle, all the ladies being finer and better dressed in the pitt than they used to be.

1663-05-08 17:01 The play was “The Humerous Lieutenant,” a play that hath little good in it, nor much in the very part which Lacy now acts instead of Clun.

1663-05-08 14:32 The house is made with extraordinary good contrivance, and yet hath some faults, as the narrowness of the passages in and out of the Pitt.

1663-05-08 14:10 To my brother’s, and there took up my wife and Ashwell to the Theatre Royall, being the second day of its being opened.

1663-05-08 10:06 To visit my Lady Jemimah, who is grown much since I saw her; but lacks mightily to be brought into the fashion of the court to set her off.

1663-05-07 13:23 The House have made an order for an Act for rendering none capable of employment in the State, but who have been loyall to King and Church.

1663-05-06 21:09 A practice of my coranto I began with Mr. Pembleton the other day, and I begin to think that I shall be able to do something at it in time.

1663-05-06 20:37 At supper comes Mr. Pembleton, and after supper we up to our dancing room and there danced three or four country dances.

1663-05-06 13:28 The old seamen tell us that they have had eleven hogsheads of oyle out of the tongue of a whale.

1663-05-06 13:23 The old seamen have catched in Greenland in fishing whales with the iron grapnells that had been struck into their bodies covered with fat.

1663-05-06 12:32 The Parliament will make mad work; they will render men incapable of military or civil employment that have borne arms in the late troubles.

1663-05-05 23:06 It fell a-thundering and lightening, the greatest flashes enlightening the whole body of the yard, that ever I saw in my life.

1663-05-05 20:39 I made it my business to enquire of Sir W. Warren what way there is for a man bred like me to come to understand anything of trade.

1663-05-05 18:29 Deane of Woolwich showed me the use of a little sliding ruler, less than that I bought the other day, which is the same, but more portable.

1663-05-05 09:42 With Sir J. Minnes, he telling many old stories of the Navy, and of the state of the Navy at the beginning of the late troubles.

1663-05-04 18:06 I do suspect that all is not kind between the King and the Duke, and that the King’s fondness to the little Duke do occasion it.

1663-05-04 15:44 Mr. Coventry and the King talked of building a new yacht, which the King is resolved to have built out of his privy purse.

1663-05-04 10:28 What with the dancing-master’s desire and my wife’s importunity, I was obliged to give him entry-money 10s, and am become his scholler.

1663-05-04 10:07 The dancing-master came, whom, seeing him instructing my wife, when he had done with her, he would needs have me try the steps of a coranto.

1663-05-04 08:26 Looking over my wardrobe against summer, and laying things in order to send to my brother to alter.

1663-05-03 22:10 I had rather talk with any body than my wife, by which she is jealous of my freedom with Ashwell, which I must avoid giving occasion of.

1663-05-03 22:07 My wife and I having a falling out because I would not leave her and Ashwell to go up and talk with her alone upon something she has to say.

1663-05-03 16:10 I to teach Ashwell the grounds of time and other things on the tryangle, and made her take out a Psalm well, she having a good ear and hand.

1663-05-02 17:27 Up to Sir W. Pen to drink a glass of bad syder in his new far low dining room, which is very noble.

1663-05-02 07:46 I to angry words with my wife about neglecting the keeping of the house clean, I calling her beggar, and she me pricklouse, which vexed me.

1663-05-02 06:54 Being weary last night, I slept till almost seven o’clock, a thing I have not done many a day.

1663-05-01 21:29 I went to hear Mrs. Turner’s daughter play on the harpsicon; but, Lord! it was enough to make any man sick; yet I was forced to commend her.

1663-05-01 20:06 In Leadenhall Street, there was morris-dancing which I have not seen a great while.

1663-05-01 18:30 I saw few good faces that there were choked up with the many bad ones, there being people of all sorts in coaches there, to some thousands.

1663-05-01 17:42 Seeing the King’s riders showing tricks with their managed horses, which were very strange, my stone-horse was very troublesome.

1663-05-01 16:58 I saw my father out of London, at the end of Bishopsgate Street, and so I turned and rode through the fields, towards Hide Park.

1663-05-01 15:47 I advised my father to living within the compass of 50l. a year, and all in such kind words as not only made them but myself to weep.

1663-05-01 10:22 Captain Grove sent me a side of pork, which was the oddest present that was ever made any man; but the fellow do it in kindness.
