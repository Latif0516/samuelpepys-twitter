1663-07-15 22:38 To supper, and then to a little viall and to bed, sporting in my fancy with the Queen.

1663-07-15 17:05 Did businesses at the Temple among my lawyers and others, thanking God I did not fall into any company to occasion spending time and money.

1663-07-15 15:49 Walking in the Hall and, God forgive me, had a mind to have got Mrs. Lane abroad, or fallen in with any woman else (in that hot humour).

1663-07-15 12:10 All the morning at the office, among other things with Cooper the Purveyor, whose dullness in his proceeding in his work I was vexed at.

1663-07-14 13:49 I made my uncle Thomas almost foxed, the poor man having but a bad head, and not used I believe nowadays to drink much wine.

1663-07-13 22:09 I home to supper and to bed, before I sleep fancying myself to sport with Mrs. Stewart with great pleasure.

1663-07-13 20:42 Mrs Stewart, with her hat cocked and a red plume, her sweet eye, little Roman nose, and excellent taille, is the greatest beauty I ever saw.

1663-07-13 20:30 All the ladies walked, talking and fiddling with their hats and feathers, and trying one another’s by one another’s heads, and laughing.

1663-07-13 19:55 My Lady Castlemaine is very handsome, but very melancholy: nor did any body speak to her, or she so much as smile or speak to any body.

1663-07-13 19:44 The King rode hand in hand with the Queen. My Lady Castlemaine rode among the rest of the ladies; but the King took no notice of her.

1663-07-13 18:59 Spying a man like Mr. Pembleton, how my blood did rise in my face, and I fell into a sweat from my old jealousy and hate.

1663-07-13 18:28 Finding many coaches at the Gate, I found upon enquiry that the Duchess is brought to bed of a boy.

1663-07-13 18:15 I met the Queen-Mother walking in the Pell Mell, led by my Lord St. Alban’s.

1663-07-13 15:04 Becky Allen is married to a fellow that proves to be a coxcomb and are in a way of living above their condition that will ruin them.

1663-07-13 04:20 I spent the whole night in visiting all the ships. I found neither an officer, nor any men so much as awake, which I was grieved to find.

1663-07-12 23:52 To the London, where neither officers nor any body awake; I boarded her, and might have done what I would, and could find but three boys.

1663-07-12 23:25 To the Soveraign, where I found no officers aboard, no arms fixed, nor any powder to prime their few guns, which were charged.

1663-07-12 23:04 I walked to the Dock, and got a boat and a crew, and rowed down to the guard-ships, it being a most pleasant moonshine evening.

1663-07-12 16:22 I dissatisfied with Commissioner Pett, convinced he is not able to exercise the command in the Yard over the officers that he ought to do.

1663-07-12 11:06 I saw Mrs. Becky Allen, who hath been married, and is churched, after her bearing a child. She is grown tall, but looks very white and thin.

1663-07-12 06:06 I did give Tom Willson my pardon, telling him only that it was well I was not a woman with child, for it might have made me miscarry.

1663-07-12 01:34 Tom Willson desired my pardon, for he thought that it had been Salmon, the Frenchman, with whom he intended to have made some sport.

1663-07-12 01:32 I found him to be Tom Willson, Sir W. Batten’s clerk, and fearing he might be in some melancholy fit, I was at a loss what to do or say.

1663-07-12 01:30 The curtains of my bed being drawn waked me, and I saw a man stand there calling me French dogg 20 times, one after another.

1663-07-11 14:56 To St. Mary Creek where Commissioner Pett (doubtful of the growing greatness of Portsmouth), do design a wett dock at no great charge.

1663-07-10 09:02 Pierce the chirurgeon tells me that the King is grown colder to my Lady Castlemaine, and that he believes he begins to love the Queen.

1663-07-09 22:42 To bed, having taken great cold in my feet by walking in the dirt this day in thin shoes or some other way, so that I begun to be in pain.

1663-07-09 16:52 Bagwell and his wife did meet me to thank me for my old kindness, but I spoke little to her, but shall give occasion for her coming to me.

1663-07-09 16:33 To Deptford and mustered the Yard to find out Bagwell, a carpenter, whose wife is a pretty woman, that I might have occasion of knowing him.

1663-07-09 09:21 I went into a little alehouse. I kissed the maid of the house, who is a pretty girl, but modest, and, God forgive me, had a mind to more.

1663-07-09 04:48 Up. Making water this morning with greater freedom than I used to do, which I think I may impute to last night’s drinking of elder spirits.

1663-07-08 21:31 Mrs Turner did bring us an umble pie hot out of her oven, extraordinary good, and spirits of her making, in which she has great judgment.

1663-07-08 19:38 I received a letter from my wife, who writes so coldly that I am troubled at it. I fear shall have much ado to bring her to her good temper.

1663-07-08 13:34 Home to dinner alone upon a good dish of eeles, given me by Michell, the Bewpers’ man, and then to my viall a little.

1663-07-08 07:24 I know not what will become of the corn this year, we having had but two fair days these many months.

1663-07-07 23:43 I called late for some victuals, and so to bed, leaving the men below in the cellar emptying the vats up through Mr. Turner’s own house.

1663-07-07 17:18 I am troubled for the rogue, though he do not deserve it.

1663-07-07 17:16 I said nothing to my boy, but caused him to be stripped (for he was run away with his best suit), and putting on his other I sent him going.

1663-07-07 17:05 I spied my boy upon Tower Hill playing with the rest of the boys; so I sent W. Griffin to take him.

1663-07-07 15:49 I should be glad to see the King’s stores and service looked to as they ought, but I shall never understand the tricks the King suffers by.

1663-07-07 13:03 In Mr. Pett’s garden I eat some (and the first cherries I have eat this year), off the tree where the King himself had been gathering some.

1663-07-07 12:14 By barge with to Woolwich, in our way eating of some venison pasty, I having neither eat nor drank to-day, which fills me full of wind.

1663-07-06 23:10 I to my office at my work till dark night, and so with good content home. To supper, a little musique, and then to bed.

1663-07-05 13:42 Methinks none of the kindness between the bridegroom and bride, that was between my wife and I, but as persons that marry for convenience.

1663-07-05 12:10 I had two pair of gloves, as the rest, and walked with my Lady in the garden, she mighty kind to me, and I have the way to please her.

1663-07-05 11:04 I got a horse and rode to Walthamstow very pleasantly, only coming to make water I found a stopping, which makes me fearful of my old pain.

1663-07-05 09:20 Lady Batten had sent twice to invite me to go with them to Walthamstow to-day, Mrs. Martha being married already this morning to Mr. Castle.

1663-07-04 16:55 All these gay men are not the soldiers that must do the King’s business, it being such as these that lost the old King all he had.

1663-07-04 16:45 One broadside close to our coach we had going out of the Park, even to the nearness as to be ready to burn our hairs.

1663-07-04 16:40 The King, Duke, &c., did stand to see the horse and foot discharge their guns, to show a French Marquisse the goodness of our firemen.

1663-07-04 16:07 A goodly sight to see many horses and officers, and the King and Duke come by a-horseback, and the two Queens in the Queen-Mother’s coach.

1663-07-04 15:10 With Creed to hire a coach to carry us to Hide Park, to-day there being a general muster of the King’s Guards, horse and foot.

1663-07-04 13:29 A pretty gentleman in our company thinks that it may be the Queen hath commanded Lady Castlemaine to retire, though that is not likely.

1663-07-04 10:47 Sir G. Carteret came to me to know what the meaning of S.P.Q.R. is; which ignorance is not to be borne in a Privy Counsellor, methinks.

1663-07-04 08:59 I learnt that the English foot are highly esteemed all over the world, but the horse not so much, yet we count among ourselves the best.

1663-07-04 04:24 I to my office looking over papers and mending my manuscript by scraping out the blots and other things, which is now a very fine book.

1663-07-03 12:29 I looked upon Backwell’s design of making another alley from his shop against the Exchange door, which will quite put down the other two.

1663-07-03 11:41 I spent half an hour in Mary Overy’s Church, where are fine monuments of great antiquity, I believe, and has been a fine church.

1663-07-03 09:32 Mr. Moore tells me that my Lady Castlemaine is fallen from Court, and retired. He gives me no account of the reason, but that it is so.

1663-07-02 20:11 My mind troubled me with the thoughts of the difference between my wife and my father in the country.

1663-07-02 12:42 Met with several people, among others Captain Cox, and with him to a Coffee House, and drank with him and other merchants. Good discourse.

1663-07-01 19:23 I found Dr John come to town, well again after his sickness; but, Lord! what a simple man he is, and talks so sillily to his brother Dr Tom.

1663-07-01 16:04 A letter from my wife wherein I find a sad falling out between my wife and my father and sister and Ashwell.

1663-07-01 13:32 They say that buggery is now as common among our gallants as in Italy, and the pages of the town begin to complain of their masters for it.

1663-07-01 12:48 My Lord Chief Justice saying it was for such wicked wretches as Sir C. Sydly that God’s anger hung over us, calling him sirrah many times.

1663-07-01 12:46 That being done he took a glass of wine and washed his prick in it and then drank it off, and then took another and drank the King’s health.

1663-07-01 12:44 Sir C. Sydly coming into the Balcone showed his nakedness, acting all the postures of lust that could be imagined, and abusing of scripture.

1663-07-01 12:42 Mr. Batten telling us of a late triall of Sir Charles Sydly, before my Lord Chief Justice Foster, for his debauchery at Oxford Kate’s.

1663-07-01 03:27 It rained so hard that it wakened Creed, who lay with me, and me, and so we up and fell to discourse of the business of his accounts.
