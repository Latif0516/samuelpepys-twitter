1663-08-15 18:06 Mr. Palmer saw by the officers’ respect to me a piece of my command, though God knows I hope I shall not be elated with that.

1663-08-15 15:43 To my instrument maker, and had my rule he made me last now so perfected, that I think in all points I have never need or desire a better.

1663-08-15 10:06 I walked to my viall, which is well nigh done, and I believe I may have it home to my mind next week.

1663-08-15 07:37 Lay pretty long in bed, being a little troubled with some pain got by wind and cold.

1663-08-14 17:41 I found my father discontented, and would have begun some of the differences between my wife and him, but I desired to hear none of them.

1663-08-14 14:14 Mrs. Harper and her cousin Jane came, and we discoursed long about her coming to my wife for a chamber mayd, and I think she will do well.

1663-08-14 08:49 It is not possible to keep Ashwell longer, my wife is so convinced, as she was in Sarah, to make her appear a Lyer in every small thing.

1663-08-13 21:37 It is impossible Ashwell could invent words so particularly, against which my wife has nothing to say but to deny, which I am sorry to see.

1663-08-13 21:20 Ashwell began to make her complaint, and I do perceive that she has received most base usage from my wife, which my wife sillily denies.

1663-08-13 15:43 We came to speak with Mrs. Harper about her kinswoman Jane Gentleman to come and live with us as a chamber mayde.

1663-08-13 13:23 My wife and I to talk again about getting of a couple of good mayds and to part with Ashwell.

1663-08-12 19:58 My wife could not forbear telling me how she had been used by them and her mayde, Ashwell, but I find it will be best not to examine it.

1663-08-12 19:33 I found my wife strange, not knowing, I believe, in what temper she could expect me to be in, but I fell to kind words, and so we were kind.

1663-08-12 18:12 By water to my brother’s, and there I hear my wife is come and gone home, and my father is come to town also, at which I wondered.

1663-08-12 08:27 A little to my office, to put down my yesterday’s journall, and so abroad to buy a bedstead and do other things.

1663-08-11 21:37 My head running upon what to do to fit things against my wife’s coming, as to buy a bedstead, because I have now no more beds than are used.

1663-08-11 19:07 On the King’s pleasure-boat, reading in a book of Receipts of making fine meats and sweetmeats, among others to make my own sweet water.

1663-08-11 17:49 I shewed Mrs. Turner Mr. Povy’s perspective and volary, and the fine things that he is building of now, which is a most neat thing.

1663-08-11 12:19 After the Queen is come back she goes to the Bath; and so to Oxford, where great entertainments are making for her.

1663-08-11 12:14 Dr. Pierce tells me that the King comes to towne this day, from Tunbridge, to stay a day or two, and then fetch the Queen from thence.

1663-08-10 20:30 I must use all the brains I have to bring my wife to any good, which I fear will be hard to do, and do much disgust me the thoughts of it.

1663-08-10 20:25 A letter from my father that says that my wife will come to town, at which I wonder that she should come without my knowing more of it.

1663-08-10 18:14 Sir J. Lenthall, in Southwarke, did apprehend about one hundred Quakers, and other such people, and hath sent them to the gaole at Kingston.

1663-08-10 17:07 My Lord Bristoll is either fled; having been sent for to the King, it is believed to be sent to the Tower, but he is gone out of the way.

1663-08-10 15:34 Now my delight is in the neatness of everything, and so cannot be pleased with anything unless it be very neat, which is a strange folly.

1663-08-10 15:10 I to Greatorex’s, and set him to work upon my ruler, to engrave an almanac and other things upon the brasses of it.

1663-08-10 05:17 Up, though not so early this summer as last, for which I am sorry, and am resolved to get up betimes before the season of rising be past.

1663-08-09 22:07 Home, and staid up a while examining Will in his Latin below, and my brother along with him in his Greeke, and so to prayers and to bed.

1663-08-09 15:34 To St. Dunstan’s Church, hard by us, and heard an excellent sermon of one Mr. Gifford, the parson there, upon “Remember Lot’s wife.”

1663-08-09 13:58 To Sir W. Batten to dinner, being invited, and being willing to hear how they left things at Portsmouth, which I found but ill enough.

1663-08-08 16:29 I shall call my brother John to task, and see what it is that he has studied since his going to the University.

1663-08-08 16:27 We began our walk, I asking many things in physiques of my brother John, to which he gives me so bad or no answer at all.

1663-08-08 12:44 I with Mr. Coventry down to the water-side, talking, wherein I see so many endeavours of doing the King service, that I do admire him.

1663-08-07 20:38 To discourse with my brother John, and I find him not so thorough a philosopher, at least in Aristotle, as I took him for.

1663-08-07 15:50 I believe Sir W. Pen would be glad I could have done less or he more.

1663-08-07 15:49 I fell to measuring of some planks that were in the yard, which the measurer himself was amused at, for I did it much more ready than he.

1663-08-07 09:45 I to my Viall, which I find done and once varnished, and it will please me very well when it is quite varnished.

1663-08-07 08:20 My measuring rule is the most useful that ever was made, and myself have the honour of being as it were the inventor of this form of it.

1663-08-07 08:18 To Brown’s for my measuring rule, which is made, and is certainly the best and the most commodious for carrying in one’s pocket.

1663-08-06 22:14 I well contented with this afternoon’s work, I thinking it convenient to keep in with the Joyces against a bad day.

1663-08-06 21:24 We to a puppet play in Lincolnes Inn Fields, where there was the story of Holofernes, and other clockwork, well done.

1663-08-06 16:03 A fiddler was sent for, and Mrs. Lurkin, a good, and merry poor woman, but very tall, did dance and show such tricks that made us all merry.

1663-08-06 14:34 The King’s Falconer speaking of the strength of hawkes, which strike a fowle to the ground with force that shall make the fowle rebound.

1663-08-06 13:21 I to my cozen Mary Joyce’s at a gossiping, where much company and good cheer.

1663-08-06 05:40 Up and angry with my maid Hannah for keeping the house no better, it being more dirty than ever it was while my whole family was together.

1663-08-05 21:07 This evening came a letter about business from Mr. Coventry, and with it a silver pen he promised me to carry inke in, which is necessary.

1663-08-05 16:35 As wanton and bucksome as Mrs. Lane is she dares not adventure upon the business, in which I very much commend and like her.

1663-08-05 16:30 To the King’s Head at Lambeth marsh, and I did so towse Mrs. Lane and handled her, but could get nothing more from her though I was near it.

1663-08-05 15:22 To Westminster hall, and there found Mrs. Lane, and by and by by agreement we met at the Parliament stairs and off to Stangate.

1663-08-05 12:04 All the morning at the office, whither Deane of Woolwich discoursed of the body of ships, which I am now going about to understand.

1663-08-04 21:30 If Ashwell goes I am resolved to have no more, but to live poorly and low again, and save money and keep my wife within bounds if I can.

1663-08-04 21:18 I fear I shall find a trouble of my wife when she comes home to get down her head again.

1663-08-04 21:15 A letter from my wife. She tells how Ashwell did give her the lie, and that my wife giving her a box on the eare, the other struck her.

1663-08-04 17:54 Nor do Palmer’s speaking in her belly take me, but it may be that is because I see her mouth when she speaks, which should not be.

1663-08-04 17:50 Palmer pretends to be able to sing both bass and treble, which she do something like, but not what I thought formerly and expected now.

1663-08-04 17:29 Thinking that Palmer is a woman of that sort that I might have lit upon a lady of pleasure (for which God forgive me), but there was none.

1663-08-04 16:49 Not finding Mrs. Lane, with whom I purposed to be merry, I went to Jervas’s and took him and his wife to their mother Palmer’s.

1663-08-04 15:27 With my brother John to his garden close by his house, where I eat some peaches and apricots; a very pretty place.

1663-08-04 08:56 We were called up about four a-clock, and being ready went and took a Gravesend boat, and to London by nine a-clock.

1663-08-03 20:10 To the Hillhouse and made ourselves ready and mounted and rode to Gravesend (my riding Coate not being to be found I fear it is stole).

1663-08-03 13:35 Mr. Pett did give us a very great dinner, too big in all conscience, so that most of it was left untouched.

1663-08-03 09:55 I caused the Timber measurer to measure some timber, where I found much fault, and we did give them admonition for the time to come.

1663-08-03 07:06 To the Ropehouses and viewed them all and made an experiment which was the stronger, English or Riga hemp, the latter proved the stronger.

1663-08-02 23:57 I sat up an hour after Mr. Coventry was gone to read my vows, it raining a wonderful hard showre for an hour. So to bed.

1663-08-02 17:44 To view St. Mary Creeke, but do not find it so proper for a wet docks as we would have it, it being uneven ground and hard in the bottom.

1663-08-02 15:52 To the parish church, and there heard a poor sermon, upon these words, “Ye are my friends, if ye do these things which I command you.”

1663-08-02 14:40 We three to private discourse and laid the matters of the yard home again to Commissioner Pett, and discoursed largely of several matters.

1663-08-02 11:10 Mr. Coventry and I to the Docke, and so on board the Mathias, where we did hear an excellent sermon upon “All is yours and you are God’s.”

1663-08-01 19:12 We pressed upon Commissioner Pett to take upon him a power to correct and suspend officers that do not their duty and other things.

1663-08-01 14:20 Being come to Chatham, we put on our boots and so walked to the yard, and walked up and down looking and inquiring into many businesses.

1663-08-01 11:03 Mr. Coventry and I by water to Gravesend (his man Lambert with us), and there eat a bit and so mounted.

1663-08-01 05:52 Up betimes and got me ready, and so to the office and put things in order for my going.
